# Sowell on Wales and the Scottish Highlands: An Analysis of *Conquests and Cultures* Chapter 2

Thomas Sowell's *Conquests and Cultures: An International History* (1998) is the third volume of his trilogy on cultural capital, following *Race and Culture* (1994) and *Migrations and Cultures* (1996). Chapter 2, "The British," examines how geographic isolation within the British Isles created stark developmental disparities among peoples who shared the same island.

## Sowell's Core Argument

Sowell uses Wales and the Scottish Highlands as case studies demonstrating that **geographic isolation is the fundamental barrier to human capital accumulation**, regardless of race or inherent capacity. These Celtic populations were not genetically inferior to their lowland neighbors—they were culturally isolated by terrain.

### The Welsh Case

#### Geographic Reality

Wales consists predominantly of mountainous terrain that historically impeded communication with the English lowlands. Sowell emphasizes that:

- Mountain barriers prevented the free flow of ideas, technologies, and institutions from more developed regions
- The Welsh remained largely pastoral and tribal while lowland England developed commercial agriculture, urbanization, and eventually industry
- Linguistic isolation (Welsh vs. English) compounded geographic isolation, restricting access to the broader "cultural universe" of English-language knowledge

#### Human Capital Deficit

Sowell documents that Welsh immigrants to industrial England and America initially occupied the lowest rungs of the economic ladder—not because of discrimination against Celts per se, but because they arrived without the human capital prerequisites that other populations possessed:

- Low literacy rates compared to English and Scottish lowlanders
- Limited exposure to commercial/urban occupational skills
- Clan-based social organization unsuited to modern labor markets

#### The Transformation

Crucially, Sowell shows that Welsh disadvantage was **temporary**. Once geographic barriers were overcome through roads, railways, and especially through migration to industrial centers, the Welsh rapidly acquired human capital and closed the gap with other British populations. By the 20th century, no meaningful socioeconomic gap remained between Welsh and English populations in comparable circumstances.

### The Scottish Highlands Case

Sowell draws an even sharper distinction between the Scottish Highlands and Lowlands than between Wales and England.

#### Two Scotlands

The Scottish Lowlands—geographically accessible, commercially oriented, connected to continental trade—developed very differently from the Highlands:

| Factor | Scottish Highlands | Scottish Lowlands |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Terrain | Mountains, glens, isolated valleys | Rolling hills, accessible coast |
| Economy | Pastoral, subsistence | Commercial agriculture, trade, industry |
| Social Organization | Clan-based, feudal loyalty | Market-oriented, urban |
| Literacy | Low; Gaelic-speaking | High; English-speaking |
| Integration | Isolated from broader culture | Connected to European currents |

#### The Highlander as a Laggard

Sowell describes pre-1745 Highland society as:

- Dominated by clan chiefs who commanded personal loyalty rather than economic productivity
- Characterized by cattle-raiding, feuding, and chronic violence
- Resistant to outside influence and suspicious of commerce
- Illiterate in both Gaelic and English

This was not a romantic "noble savage" portrait but a description of a society trapped by isolation from the human capital accumulation occurring elsewhere.

#### Post-Culloden Transformation

The defeat at Culloden (1746) and the subsequent destruction of the Highland clan system by British authorities, while brutal, ultimately integrated Highlanders into the broader British economy. Sowell notes:

- Forced clearances, while tragic, pushed populations into contexts where they could acquire new skills
- Highland Scots who migrated to Lowland cities, England, or America rapidly adapted
- Within generations, formerly "backward" Highland populations achieved parity with other British groups

### The "Black Redneck" Connection

Sowell makes an important connection between the Scottish Highlands/Borders region and American cultural patterns in his later work *Black Rednecks and White Liberals* (2005). He argues that:

- The violent, honor-based "cracker" culture of the American South originated from the lawless regions of the Anglo-Scottish borderlands and Ulster
- Scots-Irish immigrants brought behavioral patterns (contempt for formal education, touchy personal honor, readiness for violence) that made sense in a stateless border region but became dysfunctional in a modern economy
- This culture was transmitted to poor Southern whites and then to blacks who lived among them, persisting long after its original adaptive context had vanished

This represents cultural transmission across the Atlantic—a portable human capital *deficit* rather than the portable human capital *advantage* characteristic of middleman minorities.

## Theoretical Implications

### Against Racial Determinism

Sowell's Wales/Highlands analysis is explicitly **anti-hereditarian**:

- The Celts were genetically indistinguishable from their lowland neighbors
- They lagged not due to any innate deficiency but due to geographic isolation
- When isolation ended, gaps closed rapidly—too rapidly for genetic selection

This is a direct refutation of racial theories that would attribute Celtic/Anglo-Saxon differences to biology.

### Against Institutional Determinism Alone

While Sowell acknowledges the role of institutions, the Wales/Highlands cases show that:

- Populations under the *same* British legal institutions (post-conquest) still diverged due to geographic isolation
- Institutional access alone was insufficient without the human capital to utilize institutions
- The decisive variable was access to the "cultural universe"—literacy, language, knowledge networks

### For Cultural/Human Capital Theory

The Welsh and Highland cases support Sowell's central thesis that:

1. **Human capital is portable** — Once acquired, it travels with migrants
2. **Human capital deficits are remediable** — Isolation can be overcome
3. **Geography shapes culture** — Physical barriers create cultural isolation
4. **Culture shapes outcomes** — Isolated cultures lack prerequisites for modern success
5. **Transformation is possible within generations** — No genetic determinism implied

## Comparison with Scots Enlightenment

The Scottish Enlightenment case (already documented in comparative-development.md) complements the Highlands analysis:

| Population | Pre-Integration Status | Trigger | Post-Integration Outcome |
|------------|----------------------|---------|--------------------------|
| Scottish Lowlands | "Backward fringes" | Union of 1707 | Adam Smith, Hume, Watt within generations |
| Scottish Highlands | Even more isolated | Culloden + Clearances | Integration within 2-3 generations |
| Wales | Mountainous isolation | Industrialization + railways | Full integration by 20th century |

All three cases demonstrate the same pattern: **geographic isolation creates human capital deficits; ending isolation enables rapid catch-up.**

## Critique and Limitations

### Potential Objections

1. **Romanticization of conquest** — Critics argue Sowell downplays the trauma of Highland clearances and Welsh cultural suppression in emphasizing the "benefits" of integration

2. **Agency neglected** — The analysis treats Celtic populations as passive recipients of integration rather than active agents who made choices about adaptation

3. **Selection effects** — Those who migrated successfully may have been pre-selected for traits that enabled adaptation; those who stayed behind may have had different characteristics

4. **Counterfactuals unclear** — Would Wales or the Highlands have developed differently under autonomous rule? The comparison assumes integration was the only path to development

### Sowell's Response

Sowell would likely respond:

- He is not celebrating conquest, merely documenting its effects
- The point is not moral judgment but causal analysis
- Results matter more than intentions; post-integration outcomes were better than pre-integration status quo
- Autonomous development was prevented by geography, not merely by English conquest

## Application to the Comparative Development Framework

### Theory Matrix Placement

| Experiment | Period | Institutionalism | Cultural Determinism | Geographic Determinism | Human Capital Theory | Selectionism |
|------------|--------|------------------|---------------------|----------------------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Wales Integration** | 1536-1900 | ✓ English law extended | ✚ Cultural isolation → deficit | ✚ Mountains → isolation | ✚ Integration → HC acquisition | — Too rapid |
| **Highland Integration** | 1746-1900 | ✓ British law imposed | ✚ Clan culture → deficit | ✚ Terrain → isolation | ✚ Migration → HC acquisition | — Too rapid |

### Key Natural Experiment Characteristics

**Control Variables:**
- Same island, same race, same ultimate legal system
- Geographic variation within single polity

**Treatment Variable:**
- Degree of geographic isolation from commercial/literate centers

**Outcome:**
- Isolation → backwardness; integration → rapid catch-up

**Theory Support:**
- **Geographic Determinism**: ✚ Geography creates isolation that shapes development
- **Cultural Determinism**: ✚ Isolation creates cultural deficits that persist until contact
- **Human Capital Theory**: ✚ Deficits are remediable through integration and education
- **Selectionism**: ✗ Changes too rapid for genetic selection (2-4 generations)
- **Institutionalism**: ✓ Institutions matter but are insufficient without HC prerequisites

## Conclusion

Sowell's analysis of Wales and the Scottish Highlands in *Conquests and Cultures* Chapter 2 provides crucial evidence for his broader thesis about human capital and development. These cases demonstrate that:

1. Developmental differences between neighboring populations can arise from geography rather than genetics
2. "Backwardness" is a condition, not an identity—it can be remedied
3. The key variable is access to the "cultural universe" of accumulated human knowledge
4. Integration with more developed economies, while often traumatic, enables rapid catch-up
5. Cultural patterns developed in isolation can become dysfunctional when contexts change

The Wales and Highland cases thus serve as "intra-British" natural experiments that illuminate the same dynamics Sowell observes globally: geographic isolation creates human capital deficits, and ending isolation enables transformation within generations.
