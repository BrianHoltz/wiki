# Comparative Development: Competing Theories

A catalog of evidence (esp. natural experiments) supporting various explanatory factors for differential economic development of different peoples, nations, regions, and continents.

## Natural Experiments: Theory Matrix

This table summarizes how major historical natural experiments support or challenge each theoretical framework. **Strong Support (✚)** indicates the experiment provides primary evidence for that theory. **Support (✓)** indicates consistent with but not definitive for the theory. **Neutral (—)** means the experiment doesn't clearly favor or disfavor the theory. **Challenges (✗)** means the experiment provides evidence against the theory.

## Detailed Natural Experiments

### Institutional Experiments (Same Culture, Different Institutions)

#### North vs. South Korea (1945-present)
**Control Variables**: Same language, culture, ethnicity, historical experience, geographic peninsula
**Treatment**: Communist central planning (North) vs. Market capitalism (South)
**Outcomes**:
- GDP per capita ratio: ~14:1 in favor of South Korea
- Night satellite imagery: South brilliantly lit, North almost completely dark
- Physical health: Height and health differences due to systematic malnutrition in North
- Systemic famine in North, prosperity in South

**Theory Implications**:
- **Institutionalism**: ✚ Definitive evidence that institutions override culture
- **Cultural Determinism**: Ruled out (culture held constant)
- **Geographic Determinism**: Ruled out (geography held constant)
- **Human Capital Theory**: ✓ South's institutions enabled HC development, North's destroyed it

#### East vs. West Germany (1945-1990)
**Control Variables**: Same language, culture, ethnicity; pre-war provinces like Saxony were industrial leaders
**Treatment**: Central planning (East) vs. Capitalism (West)
**Outcomes**:
- Massive total factor productivity gap
- Economic base retrogression in East
- Divergent social structures (divorce rates, education systems)
- Legacy persists post-reunification

**Theory Implications**:
- **Institutionalism**: ✚ Identical cultural base, radically different outcomes from institutional divergence
- **Cultural Determinism**: Ruled out initially, but culture began diverging under different institutions
- **Geographic Determinism**: Ruled out (geography constant)

#### China vs. Taiwan (1949-present)
**Control Variables**: Han Chinese population, similar cultural traditions
**Treatment**: Maoist collectivism (Mainland) vs. Export-oriented market economy (Taiwan)
**Outcomes**: Taiwan achieved dramatically higher GDP per capita for decades until mainland reforms

**Theory Implications**:
- **Institutionalism**: ✚ Same ethnic group, different institutions → massive divergence
- **Cultural Determinism**: Culture constant but utilized differently under different institutions

### Cultural Capital Experiments

#### Middleman Minorities (Various periods/locations)
**Natural Experiment**: Same ethnic groups succeed across radically different institutional and geographic contexts
**Groups**: Overseas Chinese (Southeast Asia), Jews (Europe/Middle East), Lebanese (West Africa), Indians/Parsees (East Africa), Ibos (Nigeria)

**Pattern**:
- Begin in poverty, often as petty peddlers
- Face political hostility, labeled "parasites"
- Rise to economic dominance through: extreme frugality, high literacy, educational emphasis, in-group trust
- Their departure causes economic collapse in host countries (e.g., Indians expelled from Uganda)

**Theory Implications**:
- **Cultural Determinism**: ✚ Portable cultural capital succeeds across diverse contexts
- **Human Capital Theory**: ✚ Groups carry specific skills/habits that generate success
- **Institutionalism**: ✓ Often succeed despite hostile institutions
- **Selectionism**: ✓ Cultural traits persist across generations

#### Scots Enlightenment (1707-1800)
**Baseline**: Scots were "backward fringes of European civilization" - tribal, largely illiterate
**Treatment**: Union of 1707 opened access to English language, literacy, wider cultural universe
**Outcome**: Within generations produced Adam Smith, David Hume, James Watt - "burst upon the world scene"

**Theory Implications**:
- **Cultural Determinism**: ✚ Rapid cultural acquisition transformed capabilities
- **Human Capital Theory**: ✚ Acquired "missing prerequisites" (literacy, language access)
- **Institutionalism**: ✓ Union provided access to English markets and institutions
- **Selectionism**: ✗ Too rapid for genetic selection

#### West Indian vs. African American (20th century US)
**Control Variables**: Same race, same institutions (US laws), similar geography
**Difference**: Different cultural starting points and historical experiences
**Outcome**: West Indian immigrants and their descendants showed higher average socioeconomic outcomes

**Theory Implications**:
- **Cultural Determinism**: ✚ Different cultural orientations produce different outcomes under same institutions
- **Institutionalism**: ✗ Same institutions, different outcomes
- **Human Capital Theory**: ✓ Different emphasis on education and entrepreneurship
- **Genetic Determinism**: ✗ Same genetic ancestry, different outcomes

### Geographic and Isolation Experiments

#### Japan Meiji Restoration (1868-1920)
**Baseline**: Feudal, isolated island nation with poor natural resources and mountainous terrain
**Treatment**: Deliberate openness to Western technology and institutions; massive investment in education
**Outcome**: Rapid industrialization, became major power within 50 years

**Theory Implications**:
- **Geographic Determinism**: ✗ Poor geography/resources but achieved success
- **Cultural Determinism**: ✚ Cultural emphasis on discipline, learning, adaptation
- **Human Capital Theory**: ✚ Massive investment in education and skills; built on Edo period literacy
- **Institutionalism**: ✓ Reformed institutions to enable modernization
- **Selectionism**: — Too rapid for genetic selection (Edo period only 265 years)

#### Singapore (1965-present)
**Baseline**: Tiny tropical island, no natural resources, ethnically diverse
**Treatment**: Strong rule of law, market institutions, education-first policy, selective immigration
**Outcome**: Became one of world's wealthiest nations

**Theory Implications**:
- **Geographic Determinism**: ✗ Tropical, no resources, yet succeeded
- **Cultural Determinism**: ✚ Chinese middleman minority work ethic
- **Institutionalism**: ✓ Property rights and rule of law
- **Human Capital Theory**: ✚ Education-first policy, selective immigration

#### Sub-Saharan Africa Geography
**Geographic Handicaps**:
- Smooth coastline: Few natural harbors vs. Europe's indented coast
- Rivers with cataracts: Unnavigable vs. Europe's gently flowing rivers
- Sahara Desert: Isolated from Mediterranean civilizations for centuries
- Narrow coastal plains: Only ~20 miles vs. Europe's wide plains
- Topography: Mountains and jungles create cultural fragmentation

**Outcomes**:
- Africa has 10% of world population but 1/3 of world's languages (isolation indicator)
- Late development of large-scale urbanization and complex states
- Limited integration with Eurasian technological developments

**Theory Implications**:
- **Geographic Determinism**: ✚ Physical barriers to trade and cultural exchange
- **Cultural Determinism**: Geography shaped "cultural universe" available
- **Human Capital Theory**: Isolation prevented HC accumulation from outside sources

### Prehistoric Human Capital Transfers

#### Yamnaya into Europe (3000 BCE)
**Technology Transferred**: Horse domestication, wheeled vehicles, pastoralism
**Outcome**: Fundamental transformation of European genetics and linguistics; Indo-European language family dominance

#### Austronesian Expansion (3000 BCE)
**Technology Transferred**: Sail, outrigger canoe, advanced horticulture
**Outcome**: Colonization of vast Pacific distances, from Madagascar to Easter Island

#### Bantu Expansion (1000 BCE)
**Technology Transferred**: Agriculture, iron-working
**Outcome**: Displacement of hunter-gatherer groups; Bantu languages dominate sub-Saharan Africa

#### Yayoi into Japan (1000 BCE)
**Technology Transferred**: Wetland rice agriculture
**Outcome**: Replaced hunter-gatherer Jomon culture; laid agrarian foundation for Japanese civilization

**Theory Implications for All Prehistoric Displacements**:
- **Human Capital Theory**: ✚ Technology/skill differentials explain displacement
- **Cultural Determinism**: ✓ New cultural packages spread with migrations
- **Geographic Determinism**: ✓ Geography shaped which technologies emerged where
- **Selectionism**: — These are displacements/migrations, not selection within populations

### Multi-Millennial Displacement Experiments

These represent encounters between societies separated by 1,000+ years of differential development:

#### Spanish Conquests (1492-1532)
**Cases**: Taino (1492), Aztecs (1519), Incas (1532)
**Human Capital Gap**:
- Spanish: Literacy, metallurgy (steel weapons/armor), horses, oceangoing ships, gunpowder
- Indigenous: Stone age technology, no written language, no draft animals, no iron

**Additional Factor**: Disease - Eurasian populations carried diseases that devastated isolated American populations

**Theory Implications**:
- **Human Capital Theory**: ✚ Multi-millennial technology gap was decisive
- **Geographic Determinism**: ✓ Eurasian landmass advantages (Diamond's thesis)
- **Selectionism**: ✓ Eurasian populations had longer civilizational development timeline
- **Cultural Determinism**: ✓ Spanish brought complete cultural/institutional package

#### Aboriginal Australia vs. British (1788-1900)
**Baseline**: Aboriginal peoples lived atop massive iron ore deposits for 65,000+ years without developing iron use
**Human Capital Gap**: Complete absence of agriculture, metallurgy, writing, complex political organization
**Outcome**: Rapid displacement; subsequent development driven by British human capital

**Theory Implications**:
- **Human Capital Theory**: ✚ Dramatic HC gap from 65,000 years of geographic isolation
- **Geographic Determinism**: ✗ Aboriginals survived harsh geography for millennia but didn't develop advanced technology; geography alone insufficient
- **Selectionism**: ✓ Extreme isolation prevented cumulative HC development

#### New Zealand Maori vs. British (1769-1900)
**Baseline**: Maori had agriculture and complex social organization but no metallurgy or writing
**Outcome**: Displacement by technologically superior British settlers

### The Roman Britain Case

#### Roman Conquest of Britain (43-410 CE)
**Baseline**: Tribal Celtic peoples, largely illiterate
**Transfer**: Roman alphabet, legal system, urban infrastructure, engineering
**Outcome**: Foundation for later British civilization - "We owe London to Rome" (Churchill)

**Long-term Multiplier**: British literacy in Roman alphabet gave Western Europe centuries of head start over Eastern Europe (which adopted Cyrillic later)

**Theory Implications**:
- **Human Capital Theory**: ✚ Literacy and institutional knowledge transplanted
- **Institutionalism**: ✚ Roman legal/administrative systems
- **Cultural Determinism**: ✓ Roman culture package transplanted
- **Path Dependency**: Early literacy advantage compounded over centuries

#### Eastern vs. Western Europe Development Lag
**Cause**: Western European languages became literate in Roman alphabet centuries before Eastern European languages
**Additional Factors**: Eastern Europe suffered repeated subjugation (Mongols, Germans, Ottomans, Habsburgs)
**Outcome**: Persistent development gap; Eastern European immigrants to US/Australia initially lagged

**Theory Implications**:
- **Human Capital Theory**: ✚ Earlier literacy provided cumulative advantage
- **Institutionalism**: ✓ Repeated subjugation prevented stable institutional development
- **Path Dependency**: ✚ Early advantages compound over centuries

## Institutionalism

Institutions (property rights, governance, rule of law) as primary driver

### Key Evidence

**Colonial Origins (Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson 2001)** — The foundational instrumental variables study showing that historically higher settler mortality led Europeans to install extractive institutions in many colonies, while low-mortality regions received inclusive institutions with property rights and constraints on elites. These institutions persisted after independence and strongly predict modern income differences. Uses settler mortality as an instrument to argue institutions, not geography, drive development.

**Governing the Commons (Ostrom 1990)** — Demonstrates that communities worldwide develop stable, efficient institutions to govern shared resources without centralized states or privatization. Uses case studies (forests, fisheries, irrigation) to show how common-pool resource users create monitoring, sanctioning, and conflict-resolution mechanisms, challenging the "tragedy of the commons" narrative.

**Seeing Like a State (Scott 1998)** — Analyzes failed high-modernist social-engineering projects (Soviet collectivization, Tanzania villagization, scientific forestry). Shows how top-down attempts to optimize society generate catastrophic unintended consequences when state vision overestimates and local knowledge ("metis") is underestimated.

**Development as Freedom (Sen 1999)** — Argues development is best understood as expansion of human freedom—the capabilities people have to lead lives they value. Critiques narrow metrics (GDP, growth-first strategies) and emphasizes education, health, rights, and governance as intrinsic development components. Shows how famine, poverty, and oppression stem from failures in political freedom and information flow, not resource scarcity.

## Cultural Determinism

Cultural values, work habits, social capital as primary driver

### Key Evidence

**The Wealth and Poverty of Nations (Landes 1998)** — Attributes global inequality primarily to cultural and institutional variation. Major contribution to comparative economic history that critiques geographic determinism and emphasizes the role of cultural attitudes toward work, innovation, and social organization.

**Race and Culture: A World View (Sowell 1994)** — Argues that cultural patterns—work habits, family structure, entrepreneurship, literacy, social capital—explain persistent group outcome differences across societies. Synthesizes global historical data to show that migration, geographic displacement, and institutional incentives shape group success more than genetics or discrimination alone. Introduces framework of "middleman minorities," human-capital niches, and cultural capital transfer.

**Race, Culture, and Equality (Sowell 1998)** — Argues cultural patterns, not genetics or discrimination alone, explain group differences. Uses cross-cultural and historical evidence to demonstrate the persistence and transmission of cultural practices across generations and geographic contexts.

**Bourgeois Dignity (McCloskey 2010)** — Argues that the Industrial Revolution and modern economic growth resulted primarily from a cultural shift in how bourgeois commercial activity was perceived and valued in Northwestern Europe. Contends that neither institutions, capital accumulation, nor geography alone can explain the "Great Enrichment"—rather, it was the elevation of market-tested innovation in public rhetoric and ethical discourse.

## Geographic Determinism

Geography, climate, ecology as primary driver

### Key Evidence

**Guns, Germs, and Steel (Diamond 1997)** — Explains global inequality primarily via geographic and ecological luck. Argues that Eurasia's east-west orientation, availability of domesticable plants and animals, and disease environment gave European and Asian societies decisive advantages in agricultural productivity, technological diffusion, and military power. Explicitly argues against genetic explanations of civilizational development, contending that environmental endowments determined which societies developed complex states, writing systems, and advanced technology.

## Human Capital Theory

Cognitive ability, education, skills as primary driver

### Key Evidence

**Human Capital (Becker 1964)** — Establishes education, skills, and cognitive traits as forms of capital yielding measurable returns to individuals and societies. Provides the foundational economic theory linking micro-level human attributes to macro-level development outcomes. Demonstrates how investment in human capital drives productivity growth, income differences, and national development trajectories. One of the most influential books in 20th-century economics, underpinning vast literatures on inequality, schooling, and labor markets.

**The Bell Curve (Herrnstein & Murray 1994)** — Argues that cognitive ability is a major predictor of socioeconomic outcomes. Claims group IQ differences are partly genetic and socially significant. Asserts growing meritocratic stratification and a "cognitive elite." Heavily criticized for methodological issues, selective data, and causal reasoning, but remains central in debates over intelligence, inequality, and policy.

**Hive Mind (Jones 2015)** — Argues that average national cognitive ability has large, society-wide externalities for institutions, productivity, trust, and long-run development. Uses cross-country data to show that higher average IQ predicts better governance, stronger markets, and greater social coordination. Distinguishes between individual-level returns to IQ and far larger macro-level effects. Influential in human capital–centric development debates.

## Selectionism

Demographic/evolutionary selection pressures as primary driver

### Key Evidence

**A Farewell to Alms (Clark 2007)** — Claims Malthusian pressures selected for behaviors conducive to economic growth in preindustrial England. Argues industrialization reflects long-run demographic and cultural evolution rather than sudden institutional change. Places demographic selection at the heart of global divergence. Ambitious, controversial synthesis bridging economics, history, and evolution.

**The Son Also Rises (Clark 2014)** — Uses surname persistence to track long-run social mobility across centuries. Finds much higher persistence of status than traditional measures suggest, with underlying intergenerational correlation of ~0.75 remaining constant for 250+ years despite massive social changes. Argues this persistence is best explained by heritable social competence rather than pure cultural or environmental transmission.

**For Whom the Bell Curve Tolls (Clark 2023)** — Re-evaluates *The Bell Curve* using 402,385 English individuals (1750–2020) and surname-based lineage methodology. Finds underlying status correlation of 0.75 between parents and children, far higher than standard estimates. Demonstrates that assortative mating is stronger than previously thought (~0.8) when measured by lineage status. Argues life outcomes are largely determined by a "genetic lottery" and concludes only radical redistribution can break the link between genetic luck and material well-being.
