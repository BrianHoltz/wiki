## The Deep Roots of Intelligence Differences

* 2023: 2 cite/yr, 10pp by "Cremieux" (Substack)
* https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/the-deep-roots-of-intelligence-differences
* Tags
    * Differences: hereditarian, race-realist 
    * Times/Places: nineteenth-century, united-states, long-run
    * Groups: black-african-american, white-european, multi-racial-admixture
* Summary
    * Validates "age heaping" (rounding ages to multiples of 5 or 10) as a robust historical proxy for numeracy that correlates with modern literacy, height, and economic growth.
    * Analyzes 19th-century US Census data (1850–1900) to reveal Black-White numeracy gaps of approximately 1 standard deviation, comparable to modern intelligence gaps.
    * Demonstrates that these cognitive gaps persisted across different legal statuses (e.g., slavery vs. freedom) and have remained stable over nearly two centuries.
    * Discusses "Deep Roots" literature, specifically how genetic admixture predicts cognitive performance in African American, Amerindian, and Puerto Rican populations.
    * Cites recent studies (e.g., Fuerst & Hu) showing that European ancestry strongly correlates with higher intelligence and numeracy, mediating observed group differences.
    * Finds that historical "Mulatto" populations consistently scored intermediate between Blacks and Whites in numeracy, supporting a genetic admixture model over pure environmentalism.
    * Highlights Inquisition records showing Sephardic and Ashkenazi Conversos possessed higher numeracy and modern time-awareness compared to the general population.
    * Examines selective migration patterns, noting that higher-numeracy Spaniards migrated to Mexico compared to Peru, influencing long-term regional productivity.
    * Argues that skin tone ("colorism") is a poor predictor of intelligence compared to genetic ancestry, contradicting common environmentalist alternative hypotheses.
    * Concludes that group differences in intelligence have deep, persistent roots driven significantly by genetic factors rather than transient environmental variables.
* Quotes
    * ...accuracy of age reporting can proxy for numeracy, and for human capital more generally.
    * The 19ᵗʰ-century Black-White intelligence gap was highly similar to the one that has been regularly observed throughout the 20ᵗʰ and into the 21ˢᵗ century.
    * Admixture statistically explains an enormous part of the intelligence differences between SIRE groups in the U.S.
    * Substantial parts of the intelligence differences between American Whites and several contemporary American population groups can be attributed to genetic differences.
    * The way this effect manifests is in the form of greater intelligence among members of those populations who derive more of their ancestry from Europeans.
    * Admixture-related differences in intelligence... are so old... that they were observed to comparable degrees not only throughout the 20ᵗʰ century, but in the 19ᵗʰ as well.
    * The evidence presented here is consistent with there being deep roots for today's admixture-related differences in intelligence.
    * It seems likely that, for as long as they've been recorded, group differences have been similarly-sized to those observed today, and that they varied accordingly with admixture and not appearance.
    * People with heaped ages were 72% more likely to make a life course reckoning error...
    * Whatever people wish to contend about modern results, their alternative hypotheses need to be about things that vary within the populations being analyzed...
* Criticism
    * **Validity of Historical Proxies:** Age heaping is a clever and widely accepted proxy for historical numeracy in economic history (A'Hearn, Baten, Crayen), though its precision at the individual level versus regional level is debated.
    * **Admixture Methodology:** Modern genomic studies (e.g., Fuerst & Hu) showing correlations between European ancestry and cognitive scores are robust, but correlation does not definitively prove a genetic causal mechanism without controlling for subtle environmental confounders associated with ancestry.
    * **Environmental Confounders:** Dismisses environmental factors too easily; admixture often covaries with unmeasured familial wealth, cultural capital, and differential treatment beyond just skin color.
    * **Selection Bias in Historical Data:** Assumes that historical populations (e.g., soldiers, census respondents) are representative; survivorship bias and selection into "literate" or "soldier" categories can skew group comparisons significantly.
    * **Causal leaps:** Leaps from "historical numeracy gaps existed" to "these gaps are genetic and immutable." Historical persistence is consistent with both genetic transmission and deep-seated cultural/institutional transmission (dual inheritance theory).
    * **Range Restriction Issues:** Agrees with the text's own caveat about range restriction in literacy/numeracy data (ceiling effects for Whites) but this makes standardized effect size comparisons (SD gaps) potentially unstable and less comparable to modern IQ gaps than claimed.
    * **Inquisition Data:** The use of Inquisition data is an innovative but anecdotal source; while qualitative evidence of Sephardic numeracy is compelling, generalizing from a persecuted, highly selected sub-population to broad "Deep Roots" claims is statistically risky.
    * **Puerto Rican Anomalies:** As the text admits, the Puerto Rican data (where darker individuals sometimes scored higher) doesn't fit the simple "more European = smarter" model, suggesting the genetic hypothesis is not as universal or clean as implied.
    * **Colorism vs. Ancestry:** Creates a false dichotomy between "colorism" and "ancestry"; social stratification in the Americas was based on complex racial caste systems (*castas*) that tracked ancestry closely, making them difficult to disentangle observationally.
    * **Need for Sibling Studies:** As the text concedes, "dispositive high-powered co-sibling control" studies are needed to truly separate genetic from environmental effects, marking the current conclusions as suggestive rather than definitive.

## Black Economic Progress After Slavery

* 2022: 0 cite/yr, 20pp by “Cremieux” (Substack, pseudonymous author)
* https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/black-economic-progress-after-slavery
* Summary
    * Analyzes Althoff & Reichardt’s “Jim Crow and Black Economic Progress After Slavery” using linked census data (1850–2000) to trace the socioeconomic trajectories of descendants of enslaved vs. free Black families.
    * Presents striking evidence that descendants of the enslaved converged rapidly with descendants of pre-war freedmen in literacy, income, and homeownership once geography is controlled.
    * Argues that the "legacy of slavery" narrative is empirically weak; the persistence of gaps is driven almost entirely by the "Lower South" effect and oppressive Jim Crow institutions.
    * Identifies specific mechanisms of oppression—enticement laws, vagrancy statutes, and mobility restrictions—that pinned Black workers to low-wage agricultural regions.
    * Cites the success of Rosenwald schools as proof that when educational barriers were removed, Black human capital accumulation accelerated, ruling out intrinsic deficits.
    * Critiques standard "White benchmarks" as flawed due to mean reversion (poor Whites defined by zero assets could only move up), showing Black convergence was robust when properly contextualized.
    * Contends that the "freedmen" control group was highly selected for ability and "gumption" (via self-purchase and escape), making the convergence of the enslaved to this elite standard even more impressive.
    * Frames findings as consistent with Gregory Clark’s "law of social mobility," where underlying status (human capital) persists across generations despite massive environmental shocks.
    * Uses comparative examples (Cherokee Land Lottery, Chinese elites) to argue that material windfalls don't create long-term status, nor do shocks destroy it; underlying human capital is the robust predictor.
    * Concludes that the primary barrier to Black progress was not the lingering trauma of slavery, but the active, state-sponsored suppression of mobility and opportunity under Jim Crow.
* Quotes
    * Black families who were enslaved until 1865 continue to have considerably lower socioeconomic status today... This persistence is entirely driven by post-slavery oppression under Jim Crow. (Althoff & Reichardt)
    * The apparent effect of a longer time under slavery was actually the effect of living in poorer states and counties, with stronger Jim Crow laws.
    * Geography respectively explained 95% and 75% of those [literacy and education] gaps.
    * Slavery did not leave a lasting impact on subsequent generations... Nothing significant remained comparing either group of descendants within the same places.
    * The big conclusion from the study should be that there is no legacy of slavery.
    * If we define individuals in the modern census by having zero assets, we will be unsurprised to see a rapid increase in assets... The comparison is unfair precisely because it was defined as such.
    * Self-purchasing implied a huge amount about a person’s human capital. It meant they were industrious... and quite likely highly capable.
    * People of high status had genotypes that apparently disposed them to achieving high status even after radical upheavals.
    * All of this evidence is consistent with a genetic model... the vast majority of the variance in intelligence is genetic in origin.
    * Whatever people wish to contend about modern results, their alternative hypotheses need to be about things that vary within the populations being analyzed...
* Criticism
    * **Geography as Mechanism vs. Confounder:** Treating geography (Lower South) as a mere "control" risks masking the fact that slavery *placed* people there; if slavery's legacy is geographic entrapment, then "controlling away" geography analytically erases the very legacy being studied.
    * **Selection Paradox:** The argument that freedmen were "highly selected" (genetically/culturally elite) creates a tension: if they were so superior, the fact that the enslaved group converged to them implies either the enslaved were also selected or the selection effect was weaker than claimed.
    * **Hereditarian Leap:** The pivot from economic convergence data to a "genetic transmission of status" (citing Clark) is a significant theoretical leap not strictly supported by the Althoff & Reichardt data, which focuses on institutional barriers.
    * **Slavery as "Shock":** Dismissing slavery as a temporary "shock" comparable to a financial loss underestimates the multi-generational systemic destruction of family, culture, and health, which is distinct from the "loss of assets" experienced by fallen elites.
    * **Jim Crow vs. Slavery Distinction:** The sharp distinction between "slavery" and "Jim Crow" is analytically useful but historically porous; Jim Crow was the direct political and economic successor to the slave power structure, not an unrelated variable.
    * **Data Limitations:** The census-linking methodology is prone to selection bias (linking is easier for those with stable names/families), potentially excluding the most marginalized descendants of the enslaved and overestimating convergence.
    * **Rosenwald Schools Interpretation:** The success of Rosenwald schools is used to prove "lack of access" was the problem, which actually supports an environmentalist/institutionalist view, partially contradicting the text's later strong hereditarian gloss.
    * **White Benchmark Validity:** While the technical critique of "regression to the mean" for poor Whites is valid, it ignores the structural reality that even poor Whites possessed the "freedom dividend" of legal rights that Blacks did not.
    * **Windfall Simplification:** The comparison to the Cherokee Land Lottery (windfalls don't stick) critiques simple "reparations as checks" models but ignores that capital *combined with* opportunity (which Jim Crow denied) operates differently than a one-off cash windfall.
    * **Clarkian Methodology:** The reliance on Gregory Clark’s surname-based persistence estimates is controversial in sociology, with critics arguing it tracks group averages rather than individual mobility, potentially overstating the "immutability" of status.

* 2000: 7 cite/yr, 15pp by Bryan Caplan (economist; George Mason University)
* https://www.econlib.org/library/Columns/y2001Caplanegalitarian.html
* Summary
  * “The egalitarian position is not merely mistaken; it is incoherent. If people are morally equal, why should some be forced to serve the interests of others?”
  * “Correcting past injustice by creating new injustice is no improvement. Two wrongs do not make a right, even when committed centuries apart.”
  * “The egalitarian complains that life is unfair. True enough. But what follows? That some people should be compelled to sacrifice for others against their will?”
  * “Much of what passes for egalitarianism is not concern for the poor, but hostility toward success. Envy is a constant, but rarely admitted, motive.”
  * “Libertarianism does not promise equal outcomes. It promises only that no one will take from you without your consent.”
  * “If redistribution is supposed to rectify the sins of history, then history will never run out of sins. There is no logical stopping point once collective guilt is admitted.”

* Summary
    * Argues that cultural patterns—work habits, family structure, entrepreneurship, literacy, social capital—explain persistent group outcome differences across societies.
    * Synthesizes global historical data to show that migration, geographic displacement, and institutional incentives shape group success more than genetics or discrimination alone.
    * Introduces Sowell’s framework of “middleman minorities,” human-capital niches, and cultural capital transfer.
    * Provides one of the most influential non-hereditarian interpretations of racial disparities and comparative development.
    * Central to debates on multiculturalism, global inequality, and cultural determinism.

## The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life

* 1994: 500 cite/yr, 845pp by Richard J. Herrnstein (psychologist, Harvard University) and Charles Murray (political scientist, American Enterprise Institute)
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bell_Curve
* Summary
    * Argues that cognitive ability is a major predictor of socioeconomic outcomes.
    * Claims group IQ differences are partly genetic and socially significant.
    * Asserts growing meritocratic stratification and a “cognitive elite.”
    * Heavily criticized for methodological issues, selective data, and causal reasoning.
    * Central text in debates over intelligence, inequality, and policy.

## Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action

* 1990: 3000 cite/yr, 280pp by Elinor Ostrom🅝 (political economist; Indiana University)
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governing_the_Commons
* Summary
    * Demonstrates that communities around the world develop stable, efficient institutions to govern shared resources without relying on centralized states or privatization.
    * Uses case studies (forests, fisheries, irrigation systems) to show how “common-pool resource” users create monitoring, sanctioning, and conflict-resolution mechanisms.
    * Identifies design principles underlying successful governance systems, challenging the standard “tragedy of the commons” narrative.
    * Provides empirical grounding for critiques of high-modernist, top-down governance (resonating with Scott’s *Seeing Like a State*).
    * Foundational work in institutional economics and political economy, shaping development debates for decades.

## Human Capital: A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis, with Special Reference to Education

* 1964: 1300 cite/yr, 390pp by Gary Becker🅝 (economist; University of Chicago)
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Capital_(book)
* Summary
    * Establishes education, skills, and cognitive traits as forms of capital yielding measurable returns to individuals and societies.
    * Provides the foundational economic theory linking micro-level human attributes to macro-level development outcomes.
