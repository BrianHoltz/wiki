## National IQs Are Valid
* 2025: 0 cite/yr, 10pp by “Cremieux” (Substack, pseudonymous author)
* https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/national-iqs-are-valid
* Tags
    * Differences Theory: hereditarian
    * Development Theory: demography
    * Times/Places: contemporary
* Summary
    * Central claim: existing "national IQ" estimates (Lynn & Vanhanen and successors) are broadly robust and meaningful for cross‑national comparison when treated carefully and compared to independent achievement datasets.
    * Validation strategy: compares Lynn-era and later imputed estimates with independent datasets (OSF "current best" national IQ compilation, World Bank HLOs, PISA/TIMSS), reporting high correlations (e.g., r ≈ 0.9 with current best estimates; r ≈ 0.83 with HLOs).
    * Responds to the "mean IQs in the 70s are impossible" objection by distinguishing idiopathic intellectual disability from population‑level, normally distributed low means; argues adaptive‑function criteria and test norming change interpretation of raw thresholds.
    * Defends geographic imputation and Winsorizing used by Lynn as reasonable when data are missing nonrandomly, and shows imputed values correlate strongly with later, independently sampled data.
    * Addresses sampling criticisms: many alleged counterexamples rely on noncomparable norms, selective (elite or coached) samples, or anecdotal/online tests rather than representative assessments.
    * Tackles psychometric bias and Flynn‑effect arguments: claims bias is not systematically in one direction, that international achievement tests and IQ estimates load on a common g factor, and that Flynn‑type gains often reflect test bias or cohort effects rather than wholesale convergence.
    * Presents empirical modeling linking national development (GDP PPP per capita or consumption) to measured national IQs, arguing that observed low means in poor countries are predictable from development levels and robust to nonlinear specification.
    * On causality: surveys instrumental and historical strategies (head size, 19th‑century numeracy proxies, ancestry/UVR instruments) that the author claims support national IQs as antecedent predictors of development rather than mere consequences.
    * Overall tone: methodological defense of national IQ constructs coupled with pragmatic recommendations (prefer imputation‑free datasets when concerned; use achievement links like HLOs; document sampling choices).

* Quotes
    * The estimates from IQ and the Wealth of Nations hold up; they are replicable and meaningful.
    * Low IQs are also predictable from national development, making them that much more realistic.
    * Lynn’s 2002 imputed national IQs correlate at r = 0.90 with our current best national IQs and 0.72 with HLOs.
    * The World Bank HLOs correlate at 0.83 with Lynn’s estimates with imputation and 0.89 without imputation.
    * Criticisms of National IQs Are Intellectually Lazy.
    * The distinction between types of mental retardation that are demarcated by their symptoms and, thus, by their causes, is important to understand.

* Criticism
    * Sampling and representativeness remain serious concerns: many low‑income-country estimates derive from small, convenience, or school‑based samples that can over- or understate population means; see [Wicherts et al. (2010)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1041608010000348) on selection and sample‑quality problems.
    * Measurement and norming differences: test norms, translation quality, and instrument heterogeneity complicate cross‑national comparability — a point emphasised by [Sear (2022)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360665701_%27National-IQ%27-datasets-do-not-provide-accurate-unbiased-or-comparable-measures-of-cognitive-ability-worldwide) and others reviewing national‑IQ source studies.
    * Imputation assumptions can be fragile: geographic/spatial imputation presumes neighbouring countries provide valid information, which may fail in cases of sharp within‑region heterogeneity or data missing for systematic reasons (conflict, sampling frames). Cremieux shows high correlations, but critics warn correlations do not eliminate systematic bias for particular regions.
    * Psychometric bias is uneven but real in places: some cross‑cultural DIF (differential item functioning) and construct non‑invariance has been documented for specific tests and contexts; blanket claims that bias is negligible are premature without systematic measurement‑invariance testing across all included instruments.
    * Overextension to genetic causality: some proponents (not Cremieux) have interpreted national IQ maps as genetic hierarchies; mainstream scholars caution that correlations with development may reflect environmental effects, measurement artifacts, or historical institutions — causality remains contested. See broader critiques in the literature (e.g., Sear 2022; Wicherts et al. 2010).
    * Temporal stability debate: while Cremieux highlights stability, other work documents cohort and period effects (the Flynn effect and its heterogeneity); claims of long‑run stability should be qualified by data availability, changing sampling regimes, and education expansion. [Cremieux (2025)](https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/the-demise-of-the-flynn-effect)
    * Use of achievement tests as proxies: achievement datasets (PISA, TIMSS, HLOs) are powerful crosschecks but measure partly distinct constructs (schooling, curriculum alignment); equating them too readily with pure psychometric g risks conflating schooling inputs with underlying ability.
    * Political and ethical sensitivities: the policy and rhetorical uses of national IQ claims have high social costs; critics argue research dissemination must carefully separate descriptive measurement work from normative or biological claims to avoid misuse.
    * Recommended hedge: when using national IQs for inference, prefer imputation‑free, well‑documented datasets (e.g., HLOs, carefully harmonised OSF compilations) and conduct robustness checks using alternative instruments and measurement‑invariance tests.

## The Demise of the Flynn Effect
* 2025: 0 cite/yr, 10pp by “Cremieux” (Substack)
* https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/the-demise-of-the-flynn-effect
* Tags
    * Differences Theory: hereditarian
    * Development Theory: demography
    * Times/Places: contemporary
* Summary
    * Central claim: large generational changes in test scores (the Flynn Effect and its putative reversal) often reflect changes in measurement properties and test bias rather than shifts in latent general intelligence.
    * Key evidence: new cohort analyses (e.g., [Nordmo et al. (2025)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289625000121)) show divergent trends across subtests — large gains on figural matrices, stagnation or declines on math and word‑similarities — inconsistent with a uniform rise or fall in g.
    * Psychometric diagnosis: tests' relationships to g changed across cohorts (failure of strict factorial invariance); intercepts and reliabilities shifted, indicating cohort differences in how items function and what they measure.
    * Mechanisms proposed: changing familiarity with test formats (games, matrices), schooling and curriculum shifts, and cohort‑specific test‑taking strategies produce test‑specific gains that do not generalize to g.
    * Reanalysis outcome: after correcting for measurement non‑invariance and test‑specific effects, much of the apparent Flynn and Reverse‑Flynn patterns disappear, leaving modest net change consistent with demographic shifts.
    * Methodological recommendation: resolve cohort comparisons with formal measurement‑invariance testing, longitudinal/cohort modeling, and careful interpretation of achievement vs. ability measures.
    * Policy/pedagogy implication: public discourse should avoid literal interpretations of raw score trends; interventions should target demonstrated deficits (e.g., school attainment) rather than presumed population IQ collapse.

* Quotes
    * Massive changes in IQ scores over time are much less meaningful than people think
    * The psychometric answer to each of those questions is the same, and it’s one word: bias
    * Observed increases and subsequent decreases in intelligence scores do not reflect changes in latent intelligence
    * After accounting for incomparability, the Flynn Effect and its reversal both tend to disappear, leaving behind no changes in intelligence and meager score changes after they’re fully corrected for changes in how people understand the tests
    * People want to think that population intelligence shifts up and down, and that people become smarter and dumber all the time, but the reality is that the population practically hasn’t changed any more than you’d predict from shifts in demographics

* Criticism
    * National generalization risk: the clearest, best‑analyzed dataset (Norwegian conscripts; [Nordmo et al. (2025)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289625000121)) documents compelling psychometric non‑invariance, but its results may not generalize everywhere—different countries, test batteries, and timing can produce different mixtures of test‑specific and g‑level change.
    * Evidence for substantive gains in some contexts: a large body of historical meta‑analyses and cross‑national work (classic Flynn results) documents multi‑decadal gains on many instruments; these cannot be dismissed without careful, context‑by‑context comparison of tests and cohorts.
    * Attribution uncertainty: Cremieux attributes much apparent change to psychometric bias, but the proximate causes of item‑ and test‑specific gains (nutrition, schooling quality, informal practice like videogames) remain empirical questions requiring multi‑method evidence.
    * Measurement complexity: demonstrating strict measurement invariance is difficult in practice; failure to find strict invariance does not automatically imply zero change in latent ability — partial invariance or hierarchical models might still support substantive g‑level shifts.
    * Method sensitivity: conclusions hinge on model specification (e.g., how g is modeled, whether intercepts or loadings are constrained); different reasonable modeling choices can yield different substantive conclusions.
    * Distinguishing schooling from innate ability: achievement and IQ tests partly conflate schooling effects; even if psychometric adjustment reduces apparent gains, improvements in schooling‑related skills may still matter for policy and deserve recognition.
    * Public communication tradeoffs: Cremieux's prescription to retire lay talk about the Flynn Effect is defensible methodologically but risks downplaying meaningful educational or public‑health trends if those are only detectable in domain‑specific measures.
    * Recommended hedge: combine psychometric cohort methods with triangulation (historical nutrition/health data, longitudinal cohorts, cross‑national achievement datasets) before concluding that latent intelligence is stable.

## Race, Genes, Evolution, and IQ: The Key Datasets and Arguments

* 2025: 0 cite/yr, 12pp by Brian R. Johnson (UC Davis), Sam Trejo (Univ. of Wisconsin–Madison), and Marissa E. Thompson (Columbia University)
* https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202501.0379
* Tags
    * Political Theory: egalitarian
    * Differences Theory: environmentalist
    * Development Theory: human-capital, inequality
    * Groups: african-american, european, hispanic-latino, multi-racial
    * Times/Places: contemporary, united-states
* Summary
    * Central claim: the documented mean differences in group IQ and achievement are best explained by environmental causes; the available experimental and quasi‑experimental evidence does not support large, systematic genetic differences between races.
    * Multi‑method evidence base: reviews transracial adoption studies, mixed‑ancestry comparisons, national achievement datasets (NAEP), cross‑regional natural experiments (e.g., East/West Germany), admixture analyses, and polygenic‑score results.
    * Transracial adoption and mixed‑race evidence: the three main adoption series (Tizard; Scarr & Weinberg; Weinberg follow‑up; Moore) show inconsistent or null genetic patterns once age at adoption, attrition, and environmental covariates are accounted for; mixed‑race samples do not reliably show the intermediate means predicted by simple additive genetic models.
    * Measurement and test bias: many observed gaps reflect instrument content (vocabulary, schooling‑dependent items) and sampling artifacts; when tests are less dependent on prior knowledge, Black–White IQ differences shrink or disappear (e.g., Fagan & Holland 2006).
    * Environmental effect sizes comparable to gaps: examples include east–west German differences of ~6 IQ points after reunification and adoption‑related IQ increases of roughly 12–19 points in some interventions—showing environmental processes can generate between‑group magnitudes similar to those attributed to genetics.
    * Achievement and economic data nuance: state‑level NAEP and income analyses (Chetty et al. 2020) reveal patterns inconsistent with a fixed genetic ranking (variation by state, sex‑specific income gaps), undermining a simple hereditarian causal story.
    * Genomics and polygenic scores: current PGS evidence is limited by population stratification, poorly transferable GWAS, and confounding with socioeconomic structure; PGS cannot yet cleanly distinguish genetic from environmental structure across populations.
    * Evolutionary critique: plausible selective scenarios for large intelligence differences across human populations are weak; the paper argues differential selection is an unlikely explanation for systematic, large-scale racial IQ gaps.
    * Methodological recommendation: the authors call for rigorous triangulation—better controlled adoption/cohort studies, measurement‑invariance testing, longitudinal analyses, and careful integration of genomic data—to adjudicate small possible genetic contributions while accounting for strong environmental drivers.
    * Overall tone and implication: cautious but decisive—environmental explanations account for the bulk of observed group differences, and policy should focus on measurable social determinants (education, early intervention, inequality) while researchers continue rigorous, multidisciplinary investigation.

* Quotes
    * There is considerable variation in the mean IQ scores of human racial groups.
    * Such group differences may be caused by genetic or environmental effects. Here we review and refute the claims of those who argue that mean IQ differences are the result of genetic effects.
    * When researchers used intelligence tests that were not biased with respect to past knowledge (such as vocabulary), for example, the difference in IQ between Black and White Americans disappeared (Fagan and Holland 2006).
    * In sum, there is nothing about the nature of racial IQ gaps that suggests a genetic explanation, and the experimental work does not support a genetic explanation.
    * Mixed race persons of approximately equal white and black ancestry should be roughly intermediate between the white and black means if many roughly additive genetic effects determine IQ. This prediction is not supported

* Criticism
    * Transracial adoption studies are persuasive but limited: small samples, attrition, and uneven adoption timing complicate causal inference; see [Thomas (2016)](https://doi.org/10.3390/jintelligence5010001) on sample‑selection artifacts in adoption followups.
    * Achievement proxies can mislead: using NAEP or household income as proxies for intelligence conflates schooling, family structure, and measurement differences; triangulation with direct cognitive batteries and longitudinal cohorts is required (see [Chetty et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjz042)).
    * Measurement heterogeneity: many referenced IQ studies use instruments that differ in vocabulary loading and cultural content; failure to harmonise can produce artefactual gaps even when true latent differences exist.
    * Generality risk: much of the paper's review emphasizes U.S. and UK datasets; global patterns (different test batteries, migration histories, and socioecologies) may show different mixtures of environmental and genetic correlates.
    * Evolutionary plausibility is complex: the paper argues selection on intelligence is unlikely to produce large, systematic cross‑population differences — reasonable, but evolutionary models of polygenic adaptation remain an active research area and warrant careful engagement.
    * Recommended hedge: combine adoption/transracial evidence with modern genomic analyses, high‑quality longitudinal cohorts, and rigorous measurement‑invariance testing before ruling out small genetic contributions to group differences.

## The Intelligence of Nations: National IQs and Correlates

* 2024: 7 cite/yr, 41pp by Ronald Henss (independent psychologist; formerly University of Saarland)
* https://www.qeios.com/read/6IBSKW
* Tags
    * Political Theory: meritocratic
    * Differences Theory: hereditarian
    * Development Theory: human-capital
    * Groups: african, european, asian, multi-racial
    * Times/Places: contemporary, global
* Summary
    * Central claim: National IQs, as measured by both psychometric intelligence tests and international student assessment studies, are highly reliable, valid, and predictive of a vast array of national outcomes. The author argues that intelligence is the single most important human trait for explaining social, economic, and cultural development at the national level.
    * Methodology: Integrates five major datasets (Lynn & Vanhanen, Rindermann, Becker, World Bank HLO, Gust et al.) to estimate national IQs for 205 countries, demonstrating extremely high correlations among them and with PISA scores. Introduces a "Threshold Model" to capture non-linear effects of intelligence on national outcomes.
    * Key findings: National IQs are strongly correlated (often r > 0.8) with human development, social progress, innovation, health, peace, democracy, and economic freedom. Many relationships are non-linear, with intelligence only affecting outcomes above certain thresholds (e.g., corruption, scientific output, maternal mortality, GDP per capita).
    * Historical perspective: Traces the development of intelligence research, the Flynn effect, and Piagetian developmental psychology. Argues that the global distribution of national IQs reflects deep historical, genetic, and cultural patterns, with East Asia and Northwestern Europe at the top, and sub-Saharan Africa and its diaspora at the bottom.
    * Policy implication: Advocates for representative, imputation-free national assessments and warns against the misuse of national IQ data for political or biological determinism. Emphasizes that intelligence is not the sole cause of national outcomes but is a necessary condition for high development.
    * Controversies: Addresses accusations of racism and scientific bias, arguing that critics misunderstand the meaning of low national IQs and the distinction between developmental level and intellectual disability. Defends the empirical robustness of national IQ research against ideological attacks.
    * Demographic warning: Highlights the "intelligence–fertility paradox"—high-IQ nations have below-replacement fertility, while low-IQ nations have high fertility—predicting a global shift in population composition and a potential decline in world average IQ if current trends persist.
    * Overall tone: Methodologically assertive, empirically dense, and polemical in defense of national IQ research as a central explanatory variable in comparative development.

* Quotes
    * Intelligence is by far the most important human trait. This holds true at the level of individuals as well as at the level of nations.
    * The average cognitive performance of their inhabitants is the most important determinant of the social, cultural, and economic development of nations.
    * Far and wide, there is not a single variable in sight that is independent of intelligence and has nearly as much explanatory power in so many different domains as intelligence.
    * Psychometric intelligence tests and the international student assessment studies essentially measure the same latent variable, namely intelligence.
    * The range [of national IQs] extends from 62 to 107 IQ points. The difference of 45 points corresponds to three standard deviation units. Differences of this magnitude are extremely rare to find in the social sciences.
    * National IQs are an excellent predictor of the well-being of nations.
    * The gigantic cognitive differences between racial or ethnic groups are not the work of intelligence researchers. They are empirical realities that have emerged in human evolution due to extremely diverse environmental conditions and differential selection.
    * The phenotypic intelligence of nations can be measured very reliably by both psychometric intelligence tests and international student assessment tests and our national IQs have extraordinarily high validity.
    * Intelligence is not carved in stone, and so the fate of humanity depends crucially on the Flynn Effect of the 21st century.
    * It is no exaggeration to state: Intelligence is by far the most important human trait. No one will be able to dig up a variable that is independent of intelligence and has greater explanatory power than that.

* Criticism
    * **Sampling and representativeness:** Many low-income and developing countries have sparse, non-representative, or urban-biased samples, making national IQ estimates fragile and potentially misleading; see [Sear (2022)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360665701_%27National-IQ%27-datasets-do-not-provide-accurate-unbiased-or-comparable-measures-of-cognitive-ability-worldwide).
    * **Instrument heterogeneity:** Mixing results from different test batteries, translations, and norms risks conflating schooling/achievement with latent intelligence; harmonization and measurement-invariance testing are needed for robust cross-national comparisons ([Wicherts et al. (2010)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1041608010000348)).
    * **Imputation and outliers:** Geographic or regression-based imputation for missing countries assumes neighboring predictors are valid proxies, which can bias regional inferences when data are missing nonrandomly.
    * **Causal ambiguity:** The paper emphasizes correlation but does not resolve the direction of causality between intelligence and national outcomes; complex feedback loops and omitted variables (institutions, culture, geography) may confound results ([Acemoglu et al. (2001)](https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/publications/colonial-origins-of-comparative-development.pdf)).
    * **Political misuse:** National IQ data are easily politicized and can be misused to support deterministic or essentialist narratives about race and development; analysts should separate descriptive measurement from causal or normative claims.
    * **Threshold model limitations:** The "Threshold Model" is theoretically interesting but may overfit to the available data and lacks independent validation in the literature.
    * **Ecological fallacy:** Inferring individual-level cognitive ability or potential from national averages risks ecological fallacy and ignores within-country heterogeneity ([Warne (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s40806-022-00351-y)).
    * **Neglect of alternative explanations:** The focus on intelligence may underplay the role of institutions, historical contingencies, and policy choices in shaping national outcomes ([Sen (1999)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_as_Freedom)).
    * **Demographic projections:** The dire predictions about global IQ decline rely on static assumptions about fertility and migration, which may not hold as development and education expand.
    * **Recommended hedge:** Prefer well-documented, imputation-free national assessments (representative school surveys, HLOs, PISA/TIMSS harmonized analyses) and report sensitivity to sampling and instrument choice.

## The Deep Roots of Intelligence Differences

    * Differences Theory: hereditarian
    * Development Theory: demography
    * Groups: african-american, european, multi-racial
    * Times/Places: nineteenth-century, united-states, long-run
* Summary
    * Validates "age heaping" (rounding ages to multiples of 5 or 10) as a robust historical proxy for numeracy that correlates with modern literacy, height, and economic growth.
    * Analyzes 19th-century US Census data (1850–1900) to reveal Black-White numeracy gaps of approximately 1 standard deviation, comparable to modern intelligence gaps.
    * Demonstrates that these cognitive gaps persisted across different legal statuses (e.g., slavery vs. freedom) and have remained stable over nearly two centuries.
    * Discusses "Deep Roots" literature, specifically how genetic admixture predicts cognitive performance in African American, Amerindian, and Puerto Rican populations.
    * Cites recent studies (e.g., Fuerst & Hu) showing that European ancestry strongly correlates with higher intelligence and numeracy, mediating observed group differences.
    * Finds that historical "Mulatto" populations consistently scored intermediate between Blacks and Whites in numeracy, supporting a genetic admixture model over pure environmentalism.
    * Highlights Inquisition records showing Sephardic and Ashkenazi Conversos possessed higher numeracy and modern time-awareness compared to the general population.
    * Examines selective migration patterns, noting that higher-numeracy Spaniards migrated to Mexico compared to Peru, influencing long-term regional productivity.
    * Argues that skin tone ("colorism") is a poor predictor of intelligence compared to genetic ancestry, contradicting common environmentalist alternative hypotheses.
    * Concludes that group differences in intelligence have deep, persistent roots driven significantly by genetic factors rather than transient environmental variables.
* Quotes
    * ...accuracy of age reporting can proxy for numeracy, and for human capital more generally.
    * The 19ᵗʰ-century Black-White intelligence gap was highly similar to the one that has been regularly observed throughout the 20ᵗʰ and into the 21ˢᵗ century.
    * Admixture statistically explains an enormous part of the intelligence differences between SIRE groups in the U.S.
    * Substantial parts of the intelligence differences between American Whites and several contemporary American population groups can be attributed to genetic differences.
    * The way this effect manifests is in the form of greater intelligence among members of those populations who derive more of their ancestry from Europeans.
    * Admixture-related differences in intelligence... are so old... that they were observed to comparable degrees not only throughout the 20ᵗʰ century, but in the 19ᵗʰ as well.
    * The evidence presented here is consistent with there being deep roots for today's admixture-related differences in intelligence.
    * It seems likely that, for as long as they've been recorded, group differences have been similarly-sized to those observed today, and that they varied accordingly with admixture and not appearance.
    * People with heaped ages were 72% more likely to make a life course reckoning error...
    * Whatever people wish to contend about modern results, their alternative hypotheses need to be about things that vary within the populations being analyzed...
* Criticism
    * **Validity of Historical Proxies:** Age heaping is a clever and widely accepted proxy for historical numeracy in economic history (A'Hearn, Baten, Crayen), though its precision at the individual level versus regional level is debated.
    * **Admixture Methodology:** Modern genomic studies (e.g., Fuerst & Hu) showing correlations between European ancestry and cognitive scores are robust, but correlation does not definitively prove a genetic causal mechanism without controlling for subtle environmental confounders associated with ancestry.
    * **Environmental Confounders:** Dismisses environmental factors too easily; admixture often covaries with unmeasured familial wealth, cultural capital, and differential treatment beyond just skin color.
    * **Selection Bias in Historical Data:** Assumes that historical populations (e.g., soldiers, census respondents) are representative; survivorship bias and selection into "literate" or "soldier" categories can skew group comparisons significantly.
    * **Causal leaps:** Leaps from "historical numeracy gaps existed" to "these gaps are genetic and immutable." Historical persistence is consistent with both genetic transmission and deep-seated cultural/institutional transmission (dual inheritance theory).
    * **Range Restriction Issues:** Agrees with the text's own caveat about range restriction in literacy/numeracy data (ceiling effects for Whites) but this makes standardized effect size comparisons (SD gaps) potentially unstable and less comparable to modern IQ gaps than claimed.
    * **Inquisition Data:** The use of Inquisition data is an innovative but anecdotal source; while qualitative evidence of Sephardic numeracy is compelling, generalizing from a persecuted, highly selected sub-population to broad "Deep Roots" claims is statistically risky.
    * **Puerto Rican Anomalies:** As the text admits, the Puerto Rican data (where darker individuals sometimes scored higher) doesn't fit the simple "more European = smarter" model, suggesting the genetic hypothesis is not as universal or clean as implied.
    * **Colorism vs. Ancestry:** Creates a false dichotomy between "colorism" and "ancestry"; social stratification in the Americas was based on complex racial caste systems (*castas*) that tracked ancestry closely, making them difficult to disentangle observationally.
    * **Need for Sibling Studies:** As the text concedes, "dispositive high-powered co-sibling control" studies are needed to truly separate genetic from environmental effects, marking the current conclusions as suggestive rather than definitive.

## Black Economic Progress After Slavery

    * Differences Theory: environmentalist, hereditarian
    * Development Theory: demography
    * Groups: african-american
    * Times/Places: nineteenth-century, jim-crow-era, contemporary, united-states
* Summary
    * Analyzes Althoff & Reichardt’s “Jim Crow and Black Economic Progress After Slavery” using linked census data (1850–2000) to trace the socioeconomic trajectories of descendants of enslaved vs. free Black families.
    * Presents striking evidence that descendants of the enslaved converged rapidly with descendants of pre-war freedmen in literacy, income, and homeownership once geography is controlled.
    * Argues that the "legacy of slavery" narrative is empirically weak; the persistence of gaps is driven almost entirely by the "Lower South" effect and oppressive Jim Crow institutions.
    * Identifies specific mechanisms of oppression—enticement laws, vagrancy statutes, and mobility restrictions—that pinned Black workers to low-wage agricultural regions.
    * Cites the success of Rosenwald schools as proof that when educational barriers were removed, Black human capital accumulation accelerated, ruling out intrinsic deficits.
    * Critiques standard "White benchmarks" as flawed due to mean reversion (poor Whites defined by zero assets could only move up), showing Black convergence was robust when properly contextualized.
    * Contends that the "freedmen" control group was highly selected for ability and "gumption" (via self-purchase and escape), making the convergence of the enslaved to this elite standard even more impressive.
    * Frames findings as consistent with Gregory Clark’s "law of social mobility," where underlying status (human capital) persists across generations despite massive environmental shocks.
    * Uses comparative examples (Cherokee Land Lottery, Chinese elites) to argue that material windfalls don't create long-term status, nor do shocks destroy it; underlying human capital is the robust predictor.
    * Concludes that the primary barrier to Black progress was not the lingering trauma of slavery, but the active, state-sponsored suppression of mobility and opportunity under Jim Crow.
* Quotes
    * Black families who were enslaved until 1865 continue to have considerably lower socioeconomic status today... This persistence is entirely driven by post-slavery oppression under Jim Crow. (Althoff & Reichardt)
    * The apparent effect of a longer time under slavery was actually the effect of living in poorer states and counties, with stronger Jim Crow laws.
    * Geography respectively explained 95% and 75% of those [literacy and education] gaps.
    * Slavery did not leave a lasting impact on subsequent generations... Nothing significant remained comparing either group of descendants within the same places.
    * The big conclusion from the study should be that there is no legacy of slavery.
    * If we define individuals in the modern census by having zero assets, we will be unsurprised to see a rapid increase in assets... The comparison is unfair precisely because it was defined as such.
    * Self-purchasing implied a huge amount about a person’s human capital. It meant they were industrious... and quite likely highly capable.
    * People of high status had genotypes that apparently disposed them to achieving high status even after radical upheavals.
    * All of this evidence is consistent with a genetic model... the vast majority of the variance in intelligence is genetic in origin.
    * Whatever people wish to contend about modern results, their alternative hypotheses need to be about things that vary within the populations being analyzed...
* Criticism
    * **Geography as Mechanism vs. Confounder:** Treating geography (Lower South) as a mere "control" risks masking the fact that slavery *placed* people there; if slavery's legacy is geographic entrapment, then "controlling away" geography analytically erases the very legacy being studied.
    * **Selection Paradox:** The argument that freedmen were "highly selected" (genetically/culturally elite) creates a tension: if they were so superior, the fact that the enslaved group converged to them implies either the enslaved were also selected or the selection effect was weaker than claimed.
    * **Hereditarian Leap:** The pivot from economic convergence data to a "genetic transmission of status" (citing Clark) is a significant theoretical leap not strictly supported by the Althoff & Reichardt data, which focuses on institutional barriers.
    * **Slavery as "Shock":** Dismissing slavery as a temporary "shock" comparable to a financial loss underestimates the multi-generational systemic destruction of family, culture, and health, which is distinct from the "loss of assets" experienced by fallen elites.
    * **Jim Crow vs. Slavery Distinction:** The sharp distinction between "slavery" and "Jim Crow" is analytically useful but historically porous; Jim Crow was the direct political and economic successor to the slave power structure, not an unrelated variable.
    * **Data Limitations:** The census-linking methodology is prone to selection bias (linking is easier for those with stable names/families), potentially excluding the most marginalized descendants of the enslaved and overestimating convergence.
    * **Rosenwald Schools Interpretation:** The success of Rosenwald schools is used to prove "lack of access" was the problem, which actually supports an environmentalist/institutionalist view, partially contradicting the text's later strong hereditarian gloss.
    * **White Benchmark Validity:** While the technical critique of "regression to the mean" for poor Whites is valid, it ignores the structural reality that even poor Whites possessed the "freedom dividend" of legal rights that Blacks did not.
    * **Windfall Simplification:** The comparison to the Cherokee Land Lottery (windfalls don't stick) critiques simple "reparations as checks" models but ignores that capital *combined with* opportunity (which Jim Crow denied) operates differently than a one-off cash windfall.
    * **Clarkian Methodology:** The reliance on Gregory Clark’s surname-based persistence estimates is controversial in sociology, with critics arguing it tracks group averages rather than individual mobility, potentially overstating the "immutability" of status.

## Why Did Europe Conquer the World?

* 2015: 60 cite/yr, 280pp by Philip T. Hoffman (economic historian; Caltech)
* https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691168245/why-did-europe-conquer-the-world
* Summary
    * Argues that Europe's conquest of the world was driven by the "tournament model" of warfare: continuous, prize-driven military competition.
    * Identifies four necessary conditions for this model: frequent war, massive military spending (often 75% of tax revenue), heavy use of gunpowder technology, and few obstacles to adopting military innovations.
    * Contrasts Europe with China, where political unification (hegemony) halted the tournament, reducing the incentive to innovate in gunpowder technology despite its invention there.
    * Explains that European fragmentation created a "winner-take-all" dynamic where rulers fought for glory, territory, and trade monopolies, driving rapid technological learning by doing.
    * Rejects alternative explanations involving geography, disease, or industrialization as primary causes, positioning them as secondary or later factors.
* Criticism
    * **Financing Mechanisms:** Critics like Jari Eloranta argue the model downplays *how* states paid for war; the "financial revolution" (credit markets) was likely as crucial as the tournament incentives themselves.
    * **Geography's Role:** While dismissing geography, the model implicitly relies on it; Europe's geography (mountains, rivers) arguably sustained the fragmentation that kept the tournament alive, unlike China's open plains.
    * **Coal and Industrialization:** By focusing on 1492–1800, the model may overstate the role of gunpowder and understate the later, decisive role of coal and steam power in 19th-century imperialism.
    * **Cultural Factors:** The "glory" motive is treated as an exogenous preference of rulers, leaving the cultural origins of this bellicosity unexplored compared to other regions.

  * “Correcting past injustice by creating new injustice is no improvement. Two wrongs do not make a right, even when committed centuries apart.”
  * “The egalitarian complains that life is unfair. True enough. But what follows? That some people should be compelled to sacrifice for others against their will?”
  * “Much of what passes for egalitarianism is not concern for the poor, but hostility toward success. Envy is a constant, but rarely admitted, motive.”
  * “Libertarianism does not promise equal outcomes. It promises only that no one will take from you without your consent.”
  * “If redistribution is supposed to rectify the sins of history, then history will never run out of sins. There is no logical stopping point once collective guilt is admitted.”

    - Quotes: do not add surrounding quotation marks. Do not append citation metadata to each quote line (all quotes in the Quotes section should be verbatim lines taken from the target text). If the target text is not available at the primary link, include for each quote a validation link where the quote can be checked.
- Criticism: You are a mainstream academic expert in economics, statistics, history, and social science who is neutral/skeptical about the text's thesis. Give a fair but skeptical critique of the text, up to ten bullets. Use linked citations where appropriate. Do NOT include raw URLs in the criticism bullets—format any external link as a citation using the lead author and year as the link text (for example: [Wicherts et al. (2010)](https://...)).
- Tags: add a tags section with one bullet for each of the 5 tag types below, ommiting any tag types for which you can't determine any tags. Use exactly the types and tags listed below, and add zero extra text in this area.
