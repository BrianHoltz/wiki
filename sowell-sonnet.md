# Sowell on Wales and Scottish Highlands: Analysis from Conquests and Cultures

## Overview

In Chapter 2 of *Conquests and Cultures* (1998), Thomas Sowell examines the British Isles as a case study in how conquest, cultural transplantation, and geographic isolation shape economic development. His treatment of Wales and the Scottish Highlands is particularly illuminating because these regions demonstrate how peripheral, isolated populations can lag behind culturally and economically—not due to genetic inferiority, but due to lack of access to the broader "cultural universe" of skills, knowledge, and human capital that drives development.

## The Welsh Case: Conquest and Cultural Lag

### Geographic and Political Context

Wales occupied a peripheral position in the British Isles, separated from England by difficult terrain. This geographic isolation had profound consequences:

**Pre-Norman Conquest Wales (before 1066)**:
- Remained largely Celtic in language and culture
- Tribal social organization persisted longer than in England
- Limited urbanization and literacy
- Economy remained primarily pastoral and agricultural at subsistence levels

**Post-Norman Conquest (1066-1282)**:
- Norman conquest reached Wales later and less completely than England
- Welsh resistance to English rule continued for centuries
- Even after formal conquest by Edward I (1282), Welsh language and culture persisted
- Limited integration into English economic and cultural networks

### Sowell's Key Observations on Welsh Development

**The Literacy Gap**:
Sowell emphasizes that Wales lagged England significantly in literacy rates well into the modern era. This was not because Welsh people lacked innate ability, but because:
- The Welsh language lacked a standardized written form until relatively late
- English-language education was limited in Welsh-speaking areas
- Geographic isolation reduced exposure to English commercial and intellectual life
- Economic opportunities requiring literacy were scarce, reducing incentives to acquire it

**Cultural Isolation and "Missing Prerequisites"**:
The Welsh case demonstrates Sowell's concept of "missing prerequisites" for development:
- **Literacy**: Late arrival of mass literacy in Welsh areas
- **Commercial networks**: Limited integration into English trade networks
- **Urban experience**: Few large cities; limited exposure to urban commercial culture
- **Institutional access**: Distance from centers of power and administration

**The Transformation**:
When barriers to English language acquisition and economic integration began falling in the 19th-20th centuries, Welsh communities showed they had no inherent disadvantage:
- Welsh immigrants to England and America often performed well economically
- Once literate in English and integrated into broader markets, Welsh productivity rose
- The transformation was rapid once access barriers fell—too rapid for genetic selection

### Implications for Development Theory

The Welsh case supports **Cultural Determinism** and **Human Capital Theory** over genetic explanations:
- Same genetic population showed dramatically different outcomes based on access to literacy and commercial networks
- Geographic isolation, not innate ability, explained the lag
- Rapid catch-up once barriers fell argues against genetic explanations
- Demonstrates that "backwardness" can be overcome through cultural acquisition

## The Scottish Highlands: Extreme Isolation and Violent Culture

### Geographic and Historical Context

The Scottish Highlands represented an even more extreme case of isolation than Wales:

**Geographic Barriers**:
- Rugged mountainous terrain made communication difficult
- Severe climate limited agricultural productivity
- Poor soil and short growing season
- Distance from commercial centers (London, lowland Scottish cities)
- Clan territories separated by difficult terrain, limiting cultural exchange even within Scotland

**Political History**:
- Never fully pacified by English or lowland Scottish authority until the 18th century
- Clan system persisted far longer than in England or lowland Scotland
- Jacobite rebellions (1715, 1745) demonstrated resistance to English/lowland authority
- Final pacification came only after Culloden (1746) and subsequent Highland Clearances

### Sowell's Analysis of Highland Culture

**The Clan System and Violence**:
Sowell emphasizes that Highland culture evolved in response to specific environmental and political constraints:
- **Cattle raiding** (reiving) was endemic and economically rational in a pastoral economy with poor soil
- **Clan loyalty** and **feuding** were survival mechanisms in a stateless environment
- **Honor culture** and violence were adaptive responses to lack of state authority
- **Illiteracy** was near-universal; oral tradition dominated

**Economic Backwardness**:
The Highlands were among the poorest regions in the British Isles before the 18th century:
- Subsistence agriculture and pastoralism
- Minimal trade with external markets
- No significant urbanization
- Technical skills limited to basic agriculture and animal husbandry
- Literacy rates among the lowest in Britain

**The "Cracker Culture" Connection**:
In *Black Rednecks and White Liberals* (2005), Sowell draws explicit connections between:
- Highland Scottish culture (and similar Border regions)
- Ulster Scots (Scots-Irish) immigrants to America
- "Cracker" or "redneck" culture of the American South
- Aspects of African American underclass culture

The key insight: Cultural patterns developed in lawless, violent, pre-modern Scotland were transplanted to America and persisted long after the original environmental constraints disappeared.

**Cultural Traits of the Highland Pattern**:
- Touchy sense of honor, quick to violence
- Disdain for sustained labor (agriculture seen as women's work)
- High illegitimacy rates
- Proneness to feuding and clan loyalty over law
- Recreational violence (fighting as entertainment)
- Disdain for education and literacy
- Preference for herding over crop cultivation

### The Highland Clearances and Transformation

**Forced Cultural Change (1750s-1850s)**:
- Highland clan system was deliberately destroyed after Culloden
- Clan lands were converted to commercial sheep farming
- Mass evictions ("Highland Clearances") displaced traditional population
- Many Highlanders emigrated to North America, Australia, New Zealand
- Those who remained were forced into wage labor or fishing

**The Development Paradox**:
Sowell notes the tragic irony:
- The Clearances were economically brutal and morally questionable
- Yet they forced integration into commercial economy
- Highland emigrants often succeeded in new environments once forced to acquire new skills
- The shock of displacement accelerated cultural acquisition of market-oriented behaviors

**Outcomes**:
- Emigrant Highlanders showed no inherent disadvantage once integrated into commercial economies
- Rapid cultural adaptation demonstrated that backwardness was environmental, not genetic
- Modern Scottish Highlands remain economically peripheral but cultural isolation has ended
- Literacy and education levels converged with rest of Britain by 20th century

## Sowell's Theoretical Framework Applied

### Cultural Determinism: The Primary Explanation

Sowell's treatment of Wales and Scottish Highlands strongly supports cultural over genetic explanations:

**Key Evidence**:
1. **Same genetic stock, different outcomes based on isolation**:
   - Lowland Scots vs. Highland Scots
   - Welsh in Wales vs. Welsh emigrants
   - Highland emigrants in America/Australia vs. those remaining

2. **Rapid transformation once barriers fell**:
   - Too fast for genetic selection
   - Demonstrated through emigrant success
   - Changed within 2-3 generations

3. **Cultural transmission of maladaptive behaviors**:
   - Highland violence culture persisted in American South long after original causes disappeared
   - Shows culture is "sticky" and can outlive its functional origins

4. **"Missing Prerequisites" rather than missing ability**:
   - Literacy, commercial networks, urban experience
   - Once acquired, performance converged with other populations

### Geographic Determinism: A Contributing Factor

Geography set initial conditions but wasn't determinative:

**Geography's Role**:
- Created isolation that limited cultural exchange
- Made agriculture difficult, encouraging pastoralism
- Reduced returns to literacy and commercial skills
- Made state authority difficult to enforce

**Geography's Limits**:
- Didn't prevent development once transportation/communication improved
- Similar harsh environments elsewhere (Norway, Switzerland) achieved prosperity
- Once connected to broader economy, geographic handicaps could be overcome

### Institutionalism: State Authority as a Precondition

The Highland case shows how lack of state authority shaped culture:

**Pre-State Highland Society**:
- Violence and feuding were rational without state monopoly on force
- Clan loyalty substituted for legal institutions
- Property rights were poorly defined
- Contract enforcement was impossible beyond kin networks

**Post-Pacification**:
- English/British state authority eliminated clan warfare
- Property rights were defined and enforced
- Commercial contracts became enforcible
- Education became possible (schools require security)

This demonstrates that **institutions and culture interact**: state institutions were a precondition for beneficial cultural change.

### Human Capital Theory: The Transmission Mechanism

Sowell's framework ultimately rests on human capital accumulation:

**Missing Human Capital in Wales/Highlands**:
- **Literacy**: Written language and reading/writing skills
- **Numeracy**: Commercial arithmetic
- **Commercial skills**: Trading, contracting, bookkeeping
- **Technical skills**: Beyond subsistence agriculture
- **Social capital**: Trust networks beyond kin
- **Cultural capital**: Norms supporting sustained work, future orientation, rule-following

**Acquisition Through Multiple Channels**:
- **Migration**: Exposure to new environments forced skill acquisition
- **Education**: Schools transmitted literacy and numeracy
- **Market participation**: Commercial economy rewarded new behaviors
- **Institutional change**: Law enforcement reduced returns to violence
- **Cultural contact**: Exposure to literate, commercial populations

**The Multiplier Effect**:
Once a population acquires foundational skills (especially literacy), subsequent advancement accelerates:
- Literacy enables access to stored knowledge
- Commercial skills enable wealth accumulation
- Wealth enables further education investment
- Creates positive feedback loop

### Selectionism: Rejected for Wales/Highlands

Sowell explicitly rejects genetic explanations:

**Evidence Against Selection**:
1. **Rapid transformation** (2-3 generations) too fast for genetic change
2. **Emigrant success** showed ability was present, just not expressed in isolated environment
3. **Environmental explanation sufficient**: Geography + culture explain outcomes without invoking genes
4. **Within-population variation**: Highland vs. Lowland Scots share ancestry but had different outcomes

**Timescale Issues**:
- Welsh isolation: ~1000-2000 years (since Roman withdrawal)
- Highland isolation: ~1000-1500 years (less clear)
- Both shorter than multi-millennial timescales where selection arguments are stronger (Spanish Conquests, Aboriginal Australia)

**However**: Sowell doesn't deny that longer-term selection could matter in other contexts—he's agnostic on that. His point is that for Wales/Highlands, environmental/cultural explanations are sufficient and simpler.

## Comparison to Scots Enlightenment

Sowell's treatment of the Scottish Highlands contrasts sharply with his famous discussion of the Scots Enlightenment (focused on Lowland Scotland):

### Lowland Scotland (1707-1800)

**Starting Point**:
- Still backward relative to England in 1707
- But NOT as isolated as Highlands
- Had urban centers (Edinburgh, Glasgow)
- Had some literacy and commercial development
- Presbyterian church emphasized education

**The Transformation**:
- Union with England (1707) opened access to English markets and language
- Literacy surged
- Access to English intellectual networks
- Within 2-3 generations produced Adam Smith, David Hume, James Watt

**Sowell's Interpretation**:
- Demonstrates how rapidly culture can change with access to "cultural universe"
- Shows that "missing prerequisites" (literacy, English language) were the constraint
- Once acquired, Scots showed no disadvantage

### Highland Scotland (Same Period)

**Contrast**:
- Remained isolated and backward through 18th century
- Actively resisted integration (Jacobite rebellions)
- Literacy remained minimal
- Clan culture persisted
- No equivalent cultural flourishing until after forced integration (post-1746)

**The Key Difference**:
- **Access**: Lowland Scotland integrated voluntarily; Highlands resisted
- **Urbanization**: Lowland cities provided cultural transmission; Highlands lacked them
- **Institutions**: Lowland Scotland accepted British institutions; Highlands rejected them
- **Language**: Lowland Scotland adopted English; Highlands clung to Gaelic

This within-Scotland comparison is powerful evidence for Sowell's thesis: same genetic ancestry, different cultural access, dramatically different outcomes.

## The "Black Redneck" Connection

Though not in *Conquests and Cultures* itself, Sowell's later work *Black Rednecks and White Liberals* (2005) draws explicit connections between Highland/Border culture and African American underclass culture:

### The Transmission Chain

**Scotland/Northern England (pre-1600s)**:
- Lawless border regions ("Border Reivers")
- Highland clan violence
- Cultural patterns: honor culture, violence, disdain for labor, high illegitimacy

**↓ Migration**

**Ulster, Northern Ireland (1600s-1700s)**:
- Scots and Border English settle Ulster
- Maintain cultural patterns in new environment
- Become "Scots-Irish" or "Ulster Scots"

**↓ Migration**

**American South (1700s-1800s)**:
- Scots-Irish settle Appalachia and Southern backcountry
- Bring cultural patterns: violence, honor culture, disdain for education
- Become "crackers" or "rednecks"

**↓ Cultural Contact**

**African Americans (1700s-1900s)**:
- Enslaved Africans in close contact with poor Southern whites
- Many cultural patterns transmitted: speech patterns, violence norms, attitudes toward education
- Patterns persist in underclass culture long after original constraints (slavery, rural poverty) end

### Sowell's Controversial Thesis

**The Argument**:
- Many cultural pathologies associated with African American underclass are NOT of African origin
- They are of Highland Scottish/Border English origin via Southern white culture
- They persisted among blacks even as many Southern whites moved away from them (by 20th century)
- Geography (urban vs. rural) and economics explain why blacks retained them longer

**Evidence Cited**:
- Linguistic patterns (non-rhotic speech in both groups)
- High illegitimacy rates in both cultures
- Disdain for "acting white" / "book learning" in both cultures
- Touchy honor culture and violence in both cultures
- These patterns were NOT present in West African cultures or in West Indian immigrant culture

**Implications**:
- Challenges both genetic explanations (if cultural transmission from whites, not innate to blacks)
- Challenges pure discrimination explanations (doesn't explain cultural pattern similarities)
- Emphasizes that cultural pathologies can be acquired and can persist after original causes end
- Suggests cultural reform (education, cultural contact with functional cultures) can work

## Theoretical Synthesis: What Sowell's Wales/Highlands Analysis Reveals

### 1. Culture is Acquired, Not Innate

The Wales/Highlands cases demonstrate that "backward" cultures are not expressions of genetic inferiority:
- Same populations show different outcomes in different environments
- Emigration and cultural contact change behaviors rapidly
- "Backwardness" reflects isolation from functional cultural patterns, not inability to acquire them

### 2. Geography Creates but Doesn't Determine Culture

Geography shapes initial conditions:
- Isolation limits cultural exchange
- Harsh environments shape economic strategies (pastoralism vs. agriculture)
- Terrain affects state authority and rule of law

But geography isn't destiny:
- Once transportation/communication improve, geographic barriers fall
- Emigration overcomes geographic constraints
- Modern technology makes previous geographic handicaps irrelevant

### 3. Institutions and Culture Co-evolve

The Highland case shows institutions affect culture:
- Lack of state authority → honor culture and violence
- Property rights enforcement → commercial culture
- State education → literacy and future orientation

But culture also affects institutions:
- Clan loyalty resisted state authority
- Honor culture made law enforcement difficult
- Only after forced cultural change could modern institutions function

### 4. Cultural Change Can Be Rapid but Requires Specific Triggers

Both Wales and Highlands showed rapid cultural change when:
- **Forced integration** broke isolation
- **Economic incentives** changed (commercial opportunities)
- **Education** became available
- **Migration** exposed populations to new cultural patterns

Implications:
- Cultural poverty is not permanent
- But voluntary cultural change is difficult (Highlands resisted integration)
- Sometimes coercive integration (though morally problematic) accelerates development
- This creates tragic dilemmas in development policy

### 5. The "Cultural Universe" Concept

Sowell's key insight is that development depends on access to a "cultural universe" of skills, knowledge, and practices:

**Components of the Cultural Universe**:
- **Literacy**: Gateway to stored knowledge
- **Language**: Access to broader networks (English in this case)
- **Commercial skills**: Trading, contracting, finance
- **Technical skills**: Beyond subsistence economy
- **Social norms**: Trust, future orientation, rule-following
- **Institutional knowledge**: How to navigate markets, law, bureaucracy

**Barriers to Access**:
- **Geographic isolation**: Wales and Highlands were physically cut off
- **Language barriers**: Welsh and Gaelic speakers couldn't access English-language knowledge
- **Economic isolation**: No markets meant no returns to commercial skills
- **Cultural resistance**: Highland clans actively resisted integration
- **Poverty**: Subsistence economies leave no surplus for education investment

**Breaking Through**:
- Migration (forces contact with new cultural universe)
- Conquest/integration (forces institutional change)
- Education (deliberate cultural transmission)
- Economic opportunities (create incentives for cultural change)

### 6. Time Scales Matter

Sowell's Wales/Highlands analysis demonstrates different time scales for different causal mechanisms:

**Cultural change**: 2-3 generations (50-75 years)
- Scots Enlightenment transformation: ~50 years
- Highland emigrant adaptation: 1-2 generations
- Welsh literacy surge: ~50-75 years

**Institutional change**: 1-3 generations (25-75 years)
- Highland pacification effects: ~50 years
- Property rights establishment: immediate but internalization takes decades

**Genetic selection**: Many centuries (20+ generations)
- 600 years for England (Clark's thesis): barely sufficient, controversial
- 1000-2000 years for Wales/Highlands: Sowell considers insufficient
- Multi-millennial for major selection (Spanish Conquests, Aboriginal Australia)

**Implication**: For most historical cases of economic divergence, cultural/institutional explanations are sufficient without invoking genetics.

## Critiques and Limitations of Sowell's Analysis

### What Sowell Gets Right

1. **Cultural transmission is real and powerful**: Highland → Ulster → Appalachia cultural chain is well-documented
2. **Isolation creates developmental lags**: Wales and Highlands clearly lagged due to peripheral position
3. **Rapid transformation is possible**: Emigrant success proves ability was present
4. **"Missing prerequisites" framework is useful**: Focuses on specific barriers to development

### Potential Weaknesses

1. **Underplays genetic selection at longer timescales**:
   - Sowell is skeptical of genetic explanations for Wales/Highlands (reasonably, given short timescales)
   - But doesn't fully engage with arguments for selection over longer periods (Clark, Cochran & Harpending)
   - His framework struggles with cases like Aboriginal Australia (65,000 years) where selection arguments are stronger

2. **Cultural determinism may be overstated**:
   - Emphasis on culture risks minimizing institutional and geographic factors
   - Highland violence wasn't just "cultural"—it was rational given institutional vacuum
   - Once institutions changed (state authority established), culture changed rapidly
   - Suggests institutions may be more fundamental than Sowell acknowledges

3. **The "Black Redneck" thesis is controversial**:
   - Linguistic evidence is mixed (non-rhotic speech has multiple origins)
   - May understate African cultural retentions in African American culture
   - Doesn't fully explain why some cultural patterns persisted among blacks but faded among whites
   - Alternative explanation: Ongoing discrimination and segregation preserved patterns, not just cultural transmission

4. **Coercion vs. voluntary change**:
   - Highland Clearances were economically beneficial in aggregate but brutal to individuals
   - Sowell acknowledges this but doesn't fully grapple with moral implications
   - Raises uncomfortable questions about development policy: Is coercive integration ever justified?

5. **Selection effects in migration**:
   - Emigrants may have been self-selected (more ambitious, intelligent, future-oriented)
   - Their success may partly reflect selection, not just environmental change
   - Doesn't fully address this alternative explanation

### How Sowell's Analysis Fits into Broader Debate

**Institutionalism (Acemoglu/Robinson)**:
- Sowell emphasizes culture, they emphasize institutions
- But both agree on importance of property rights, rule of law, state authority
- Difference may be semantic: "culture" includes internalized institutional norms

**Geographic Determinism (Diamond)**:
- Sowell critiques Diamond's environmental determinism
- Wales/Highlands show geography creates barriers but doesn't determine outcomes
- Diamond might respond: Eurasia-wide geography matters more than within-Eurasia variation

**Human Capital Theory (Becker, Jones)**:
- Sowell's framework is fundamentally human capital theory
- "Cultural universe" = accessible human capital
- Difference: Sowell emphasizes cultural barriers to HC acquisition, economists emphasize incentives/returns

**Selectionism (Clark, Cochran & Harpending)**:
- Sowell skeptical for Wales/Highlands (short timescales)
- But doesn't engage deeply with longer-timescale selection arguments
- Possible synthesis: Culture matters for short run (decades to centuries), selection matters for long run (millennia)

## Conclusion: Lessons from Wales and the Highlands

Sowell's treatment of Wales and Scottish Highlands in *Conquests and Cultures* provides a powerful case study in cultural development theory:

### Core Insights

1. **Isolation breeds backwardness**: Geographic and cultural isolation from advanced societies creates developmental lags

2. **Culture is acquired, not innate**: Same populations perform differently based on cultural access

3. **Rapid transformation is possible**: When barriers fall, cultural change can occur in 2-3 generations

4. **"Missing prerequisites" are specific and identifiable**: Literacy, language, commercial skills, institutional knowledge

5. **Multiple factors interact**: Geography shapes culture, culture shapes institutions, institutions shape incentives, incentives shape culture

6. **Timescales matter**: Different causal mechanisms operate at different speeds

### Policy Implications

1. **Education is crucial**: Literacy and language access are gateways to broader cultural universe

2. **Integration beats isolation**: Contact with advanced cultures accelerates development (but raises questions about cultural preservation)

3. **Institutions matter**: State authority, property rights, rule of law are preconditions for commercial culture

4. **Migration can be transformative**: Exposure to new environments forces cultural adaptation

5. **Cultural pathologies can persist**: Maladaptive patterns may outlive their original functional context (requires active cultural reform)

6. **Coercion creates dilemmas**: Forced integration (Highland Clearances) was effective but brutal (no easy answers)

### Relevance to Modern Development

Sowell's Wales/Highlands analysis illuminates contemporary development challenges:

- **Why do some ethnic groups lag economically?** Often reflects isolation from "cultural universe" of skills, not genetic inferiority
- **Why does development require cultural change?** Traditional cultures evolved for different environments; modern economy requires different skills
- **Why is development often painful?** Cultural change means abandoning traditional ways, which is psychologically costly
- **Why do some cultural patterns persist despite being dysfunctional?** Culture is "sticky"; patterns persist after original functional context disappears
- **What interventions work?** Education, migration, institutional reform, economic opportunity—but all require disrupting traditional culture

### Final Assessment

Sowell's analysis of Wales and Scottish Highlands is:
- **Empirically strong**: Well-documented historical cases
- **Theoretically coherent**: Fits into broader cultural determinism framework
- **Policy-relevant**: Provides actionable insights for development
- **Morally complex**: Acknowledges tragic tradeoffs in development process

But it's **not the final word**:
- Underplays institutional factors
- Struggles with very long-timescale cases
- May overstate cultural transmission vs. selection
- Doesn't fully resolve coercion vs. voluntary change dilemmas

The Wales/Highlands cases are best seen as **strong evidence for cultural determinism at century-scale timescales**, complementing (not replacing) institutional and (at longer timescales) selectionist explanations.

## BH Critique

Too long yet well-structured and very clear. Masterful discussion of the larger context. Conscious of various Sowell sources. Arguably better than Opus4.5.
