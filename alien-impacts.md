# Alien Impacts

Many UFOlogists posit that the U.S. government has since at least 1947 had access to alien technology. They sometimes even claim that aliens have been assisting government scientists and engineers. Is there evidence of such access or assistance in the postwar history of human science and technology?

## Physics and Cosmology
The Big Bang's Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation was discovered accidentally only in 1965, by radio astronomers who first suspected the signal was due to pigeon shit on their antenna.

Quantum Chromodynamics was developed gradually in the decade leading up to the mid-1960s, as particle detectors were steadily improved and generated observations of more and more esoteric particles.

Hawking radiation was argued for theoretically only in 1974, but could have been hypothesized not long after black holes were theorized in the 1930s.

The Standard Model of quantum particle physics was not completed until the 1970s, but its 17 particles (or at least its 9 basic particles) could have been hypothesized earlier. The Higgs particle was first observed only in 2012.

Cosmic inflation was not posited until around 1980, but is required to explain the universe's large-scale isotropy. Even now, the mechanism for inflation is not understood.

The necessary existence of dark matter was not confirmed until 1980, and the nature of dark matter is still a mystery.

## Other Claimed Impacts

ProjectCamelot (2007 interview): [ex-NASA professors says:] this was a gigantic computer chip that ran the whole width of the ship, and it was a superconducting ceramic material, which means that electrons would flow through it without any loss. Now from this, the professor said, we got fiber optics. We got Teflon, the non-stick material - a special material. We got Kevlar bullet-proof vests that came from reverse engineering. Lasers came from the ships. LED lights came from the ships. Infrared night vision came from the ships (they had looked through the port-hole windows and saw this green, so that you could see outside at night), and computer chips, obviously. So what this really means is that most of the technology that we now have, including the technology that you are recording my voice and filming with, would not exist if it were not for this 'celestial inheritance' that we got in the 40's.
