# Analysis of Thomas Sowell's Views on Wales and the Scottish Highlands in "Conquests and Cultures" Chapter 2

## Introduction

In "Conquests and Cultures: An International History" (1998), Thomas Sowell examines how conquests and migrations have shaped the cultural landscapes of various societies. Chapter 2, titled "The British Isles: Internal and External," focuses on the internal dynamics within the British Isles, particularly the persistence of Welsh and Scottish Highland cultures despite English conquests. This analysis explores Sowell's arguments in the context of comparative development theories, drawing parallels to the frameworks outlined in the attached document on competing theories of economic development.

## Sowell's Key Arguments on Wales

Sowell discusses the Norman conquest of Wales in the 11th-13th centuries, led by figures like William the Conqueror and Edward I. Despite military subjugation, the Welsh language and culture endured for centuries. Key points:

- **Lack of Displacement**: Unlike in Ireland, where English settlers displaced the native population, the Normans did not massively resettle Wales. The Welsh remained in their ancestral lands, particularly in the mountainous regions that were difficult for invaders to control or settle.

- **Geographic Isolation**: The rugged terrain of Wales provided natural barriers, allowing cultural continuity. This isolation prevented the dilution of Welsh identity through intermarriage or assimilation.

- **Cultural Persistence**: Welsh language, folklore, and traditions survived, influencing modern Welsh nationalism and identity.

Sowell contrasts this with regions where displacement occurred, leading to cultural extinction or transformation.

## Sowell's Key Arguments on the Scottish Highlands

For the Scottish Highlands, Sowell examines the aftermath of the English conquests and unions (e.g., the Acts of Union in 1707). The Gaelic-speaking Highlanders maintained their distinct culture until the 18th-19th centuries.

- **Limited Settlement**: English influence was more administrative and economic than demographic. The Highlands' remoteness and harsh climate deterred large-scale English settlement.

- **Clan System and Isolation**: The clan-based social structure and geographic isolation preserved Gaelic language, customs, and kinship ties. This allowed the culture to resist assimilation pressures.

- **Late Disruption**: Cultural erosion accelerated in the 18th century with the Highland Clearances, economic changes, and forced emigration, but Sowell notes the prior longevity due to non-displacement.

Sowell uses these examples to illustrate that conquests do not automatically lead to cultural homogenization; the presence or absence of population displacement is crucial.

## Link to Comparative Development Theories

Drawing from the attached document's theory matrix, Sowell's views strongly support **Cultural Determinism**:

- **Cultural Persistence Despite Conquest**: The Welsh and Highland cases show how cultures can endure hostile institutions and geographic challenges if not displaced. This aligns with Sowell's broader thesis that cultural patterns—work habits, social structures, and identities—are portable and resilient.

- **Contrast with Institutionalism**: While institutions (e.g., English law) were imposed, they did not override culture in these cases. The document notes similar patterns in middleman minorities (e.g., Jews, Overseas Chinese), where cultures succeed across diverse institutional contexts.

- **Human Capital Aspects**: Sowell implies that cultural emphasis on education and literacy (e.g., Welsh bardic traditions) contributed to persistence, supporting Human Capital Theory.

- **Geographic Factors**: Geography enabled isolation, but Sowell argues it's the interaction with conquest strategies that matters, not geography alone.

- **Rejection of Selectionism**: The persistence is cultural, not genetic, as timelines are too short for evolutionary selection.

These examples provide natural experiments supporting Cultural Determinism, as cultures adapted or persisted based on historical conquest dynamics, influencing long-term development paths.

## Implications for Comparative Development

Sowell's analysis underscores that historical conquests create path dependencies in cultural development, affecting economic outcomes. In the British context, the persistence of Welsh and Highland identities contributed to regional diversity, sometimes hindering national cohesion but preserving cultural capital. This contrasts with more assimilated regions, highlighting how conquest strategies shape societal trajectories.

## Conclusion

Sowell's examination of Wales and the Scottish Highlands in "Conquests and Cultures" Chapter 2 reinforces the importance of cultural factors in development. By showing how non-displacement allowed cultural survival, he provides evidence for Cultural Determinism over other theories like Institutionalism or Geographic Determinism. This perspective enriches the debate on why some societies develop differently, emphasizing the enduring impact of historical migrations and conquests.

## BH Critique

Accurate and contextual but shallow, doesn't engage the literature.
