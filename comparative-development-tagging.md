# Proposed Tagging Scheme for Comparative Development Bibliography

## 1. Theoretical Perspective / Position

### Primary Stance on Group Differences
- **hereditarian** - Argues genetic factors explain group differences in intelligence/outcomes
- **environmentalist** - Argues environmental factors fully explain group differences
- **interactionist** - Argues both genetic and environmental factors matter (rejects pure hereditarian or environmentalist positions)
- **agnostic** - Does not take a strong position on genetic vs. environmental causes

### Explanatory Framework for Development
- **institutionalist** - Institutions (property rights, governance, rule of law) as primary driver
- **cultural-determinist** - Cultural values, work habits, social capital as primary driver
- **geographic-determinist** - Geography, climate, ecology as primary driver
- **human-capital-centric** - Cognitive ability, education, skills as primary driver
- **demographic-selection** - Demographic/evolutionary selection pressures as primary driver
- **multi-factor** - Rejects single-factor explanations, emphasizes multiple interacting causes

### Political/Philosophical Orientation
- **libertarian** - Emphasizes individual liberty, minimal state intervention, free markets
- **egalitarian** - Emphasizes equality of outcomes or capabilities, supports redistribution
- **race-realist** - Acknowledges biological/genetic racial differences as meaningful
- **meritocratic** - Emphasizes individual merit, achievement, and cognitive stratification
- **critical-theory** - Emphasizes power structures, oppression, social construction, systemic racism, structural inequality, historical injustice

### Policy Stance
- **reparations-skeptical** - Critical of or opposes large-scale reparations programs
- **reparations-supportive** - Supports reparations as policy solution

- **test-score-analysis** - Analyzes standardized test scores (NAEP, SAT, PISA, etc.)
- **case-studies** - In-depth analysis of specific cases/regions/periods

### Analytical Approach
- **descriptive** - Primarily describes patterns without strong causal claims
- **causal-inference** - Attempts to establish causal relationships
- **correlational** - Focuses on associations and correlations
