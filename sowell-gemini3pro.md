# Sowell on Wales and the Scottish Highlands: Analysis of *Conquests and Cultures*

This analysis synthesizes Thomas Sowell's views on the cultural and economic development of the Celtic fringe (Wales and the Scottish Highlands) as presented in Chapter 2 of *Conquests and Cultures* and related works.

## 1. Geographic Determinism vs. Cultural Evolution

Sowell uses the history of the British Isles to illustrate how geography initially shapes culture, but how culture eventually becomes an independent variable that can change rapidly under new institutional conditions.

### Geography as Destiny (Initially)
*   **England**: Blessed with navigable rivers and gentle terrain, England was accessible to conquerors (Romans, Normans) who brought advanced human capital (law, architecture, organization). Its geography facilitated internal trade and unification.
*   **Wales and the Highlands**: Characterized by rugged, mountainous terrain that isolated them from the rest of the island and the continent.
    *   **Isolation**: This geography acted as a barrier to the diffusion of human capital. The Romans, for instance, stopped at Hadrian's Wall, leaving the "barbarians" to the north untouched by Roman law, literacy, and urbanization.
    *   **Resource Poverty**: The harsh terrain made agriculture difficult, encouraging a pastoral, raiding lifestyle rather than settled farming and commerce.

## 2. The "Celtic" Cultural Package

Sowell describes the pre-modern culture of the Welsh and Scottish Highlanders as distinct from the "English" culture that developed in the lowlands. This culture was an adaptation to current lawlessness and isolation, but became a liability in a modern commercial society.

### Key Characteristics:
*   **Tribalism over Rule of Law**: Loyalty was owed to the clan or kin group, not to an abstract state or legal system. Justice was private (revenge/feud) rather than public.
*   **Violence and Honor**: A "redneck" culture (a term Sowell explicitly traces to these regions) where personal slight mandated violent response.
*   **Lack of Human Capital**: Widespread illiteracy and a lack of the "industrial virtues"—punctuality, thrift, and steady work habits.
*   **Resistance to Integration**: A strong resistance to the English language and customs, which served to further isolate them from the broader European market of ideas and goods.

## 3. The Natural Experiment: The "Surge of the Scots"

The most crucial part of Sowell's analysis is the transformation of Scotland, particularly after the defeat of the Highland clans (1745) and the Union of 1707.

### The Transformation:
*   **Breaking Isolation**: The destruction of the clan system and the building of roads by the British military forcibly integrated the Highlands. The adoption of the English language opened up a vast "cultural universe" previously closed to Gaelic speakers.
*   **Rapid Catch-up**: Within two generations, the Scots went from being considered the "backward fringes of Europe" to the vanguard of Western civilization.
    *   **The Scottish Enlightenment**: This period produced giants like Adam Smith, David Hume, and James Watt.
    *   **Disproportionate Success**: Scots became overrepresented in engineering, medicine, and colonial administration throughout the British Empire.

### Theoretical Implications:
*   **Refutation of Genetic Determinism**: The genetic makeup of the Scots did not change in 50 years. Therefore, their previous backwardness was not innate but cultural/environmental.
*   **Refutation of Geographic Determinism (Long-term)**: While geography caused the initial isolation, it did not permanently condemn the region to poverty once cultural and institutional barriers were removed.
*   **Plasticity of Culture**: Cultures are not static "identities" to be preserved at all costs, but sets of functional skills and habits. When the Scots adopted the "English" package (literacy, commercial law), they did not just "assimilate"—they excelled and surpassed their teachers.

## 4. The "Black Redneck" Connection

Though primarily detailed in *Black Rednecks and White Liberals*, Sowell connects these insights to the United States. He argues that the dysfunctional "ghetto" culture is not African in origin, but a transplantation of this dysfuntional Celtic/Borderer culture:
*   **Migration**: Immigrants from the "lawless borderlands" of Northern England/Scotland and Ulster settled the American South.
*   **Cultural Persistence**: They brought their habits—violence, touchy honor, disdain for education/bookishness—with them.
*   **adherence**: The Black population in the South absorbed this culture, and while white Southerners largely moved away from it over centuries, it persisted longer in the isolated conditions of the Black underclass.

## Summary

In *Conquests and Cultures*, Wales and the Scottish Highlands serve as a potent case study. They prove that "backwardness" is often a result of geographic isolation from the "mainstream of human progress," but that this backwardness can be overcome with breathtaking speed once the cultural software is updated. It stands as a powerful argument against both biological racism and the "multicultural" view that all indigenous cultures are equally functional for economic development.

## BH Critique

Very clear on Scotland. Largely ignores Wales.
