# The Rivalry/Excludability Matrix: Who First Built the 2×2 Grid?

The standard fourfold classification of goods — private goods, public goods, club goods, and common-pool resources — is organized along two axes: **rivalry** (or "subtractability") and **excludability**. This note traces the historical question: who first assembled all four quadrants?

## The Matrix

|                   | **Excludable**         | **Non-excludable**           |
|-------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Rivalrous**     | Private goods          | Common-pool resources (CPR)  |
| **Non-rivalrous** | Club goods (toll goods)| Public goods                 |

## Step 1 — Samuelson Defines One Axis (1954, 1955)

**Paul A. Samuelson**, "The Pure Theory of Public Expenditure," *Review of Economics and Statistics* 36(4): 387–389, 1954.

Samuelson defined what he called a "collective consumption good" as:

> "[A good] which all enjoy in common in the sense that each individual's consumption of such a good leads to no subtractions from any other individual's consumption of that good."

This captures **non-rivalry only**. Samuelson drew a binary contrast between purely private goods and purely public goods, using a single axis. He did **not** introduce excludability as a second, independent axis, and he did not name or discuss club goods or common-pool resources as separate categories. His 1955 follow-up ("Diagrammatic Exposition of a Theory of Public Expenditure," *Review of Economics and Statistics* 37(4): 350–356) elaborated the framework diagrammatically, still within a single-axis structure.

**Contribution:** The rivaly dimension — and the private/public goods dichotomy.

## Step 2 — Musgrave Introduces the Second Axis (1959)

**Richard A. Musgrave**, *The Theory of Public Finance: A Study in Public Economy*, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1959.

The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Reiss 2021, "Public Goods") states explicitly:

> "A few years after Samuelson, Richard Musgrave introduced an alternative criterion, that of (non-) excludability (Musgrave 1959)."

Musgrave distinguished "social wants" (non-rival and non-excludable) from "private wants" (excludable), and introduced the term and concept of excludability as a criterion for classifying goods. He was working toward a normative theory of public finance (his famous Three-Function Framework: stabilization, distribution, allocation), not specifically trying to build a 2×2 grid. He introduced excludability as its own dimension — independently of Samuelson's rivalry — but he did not explicitly combine both axes into a fourfold matrix.

**Contribution:** The excludability dimension, introduced as an independent second axis of classification.

## Step 3 — Buchanan Adds the Third Quadrant (1965)

**James M. Buchanan**, "An Economic Theory of Clubs," *Economica* 32(125): 1–14, February 1965.

Buchanan identified the "missing link" in the spectrum between purely private and purely public goods: goods that are **excludable but non-rivalrous** — club goods (later also called toll goods). He wrote:

> "As more persons are allowed to share in the enjoyment of the facility, of given size, the benefit evaluation that the individual places on the good will, after some point, decline. There may, of course, be both an increasing and a constant range of the total benefit function, but at some point, congestion will set in, and his evaluation of the good will fall."

Buchanan's theory of clubs introduced the third cell of the eventual matrix. The logical complement — goods that are **rivalrous but non-excludable** (common-pool resources) — was implied but not named or theorized. Buchanan did not complete the 4-cell framework.

**Contribution:** Club goods (non-rivalrous + excludable) as a named third category.

## Step 4 — The Ostroms Complete the Matrix (1977)

**Vincent Ostrom and Elinor Ostrom**, "Public Goods and Public Choices," in Emanuel S. Savas (ed.), *Alternatives for Delivering Public Services: Toward Improved Performance*, Westview Press, Boulder, CO, 1977, pp. 7–49.

Also relevant: **Vincent Ostrom and Elinor Ostrom**, "A Theory for Institutional Analysis of Common Pool Problems," in Garrett Hardin and John Baden (eds.), *Managing the Commons*, W.H. Freeman, San Francisco, CA, 1977, pp. 157–172.

Wikipedia's *Goods* article ("History of the fourfold model of goods") documents that in 1977, the Ostroms made four specific modifications to the existing framework:

1. They replaced "rivalry of consumption" with the term **"subtractability of use"** — arguing the latter was more precise because it captured the degree to which one person's use subtracts from others'.

2. They conceptualized subtractability and excludability as **continuous variables** (varying from low to high) rather than binary opposites.

3. They **"overtly added a very important fourth type of good — common-pool resources"**: goods that are rivalrous (subtractable) but non-excludable, such as forests, fisheries, water systems, and the global atmosphere. This was the missing fourth quadrant.

4. They changed the name of "club goods" to **"toll goods"**.

Elinor Ostrom later elaborated and refined this framework in:
- Ostrom, E. (2005). *Understanding Institutional Diversity*. Princeton University Press.
- Ostrom, E. (2010). "Beyond Markets and States: Polycentric Governance of Complex Economic Systems." *American Economic Review* 100(June): 408–444. [Nobel lecture]
- Ostrom, E. (2003). "How Types of Goods and Property Rights Jointly Affect Collective Action." *Journal of Theoretical Politics* 15(3): 239–270.

**Contribution:** Common-pool resources (rivalrous + non-excludable) as the explicit fourth category — **completing the 2×2 matrix**.

## Conclusion

The complete fourfold grid — with all four cells named and theorized — was assembled by **Vincent and Elinor Ostrom in 1977**. The process was cumulative:

| Year | Author(s) | Contribution |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1954 | Samuelson | Non-rivalry axis; private vs. public goods dichotomy |
| 1959 | Musgrave  | Excludability as an independent second axis |
| 1965 | Buchanan  | Club goods as a third named quadrant |
| **1977** | **V. Ostrom & E. Ostrom** | **Common-pool resources as the fourth quadrant; explicit 2×2 matrix** |

**Terminological note:** Ostrom preferred "subtractability" over "rivalry" as the name of the first axis. The contemporary economics usage ("non-rivalrous" and "non-excludable") as the combined two-axis standard definition traces to textbooks like Varian's *Microeconomic Analysis* (3rd ed., 1992, Norton, p. 414), cited in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy as a canonical modern statement of the public goods definition using both criteria.
