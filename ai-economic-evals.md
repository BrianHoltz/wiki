# Economic Evals

LLMs are being proclaimed as achieving AGI because they are saturating evals that are non-agentic one-shot quizzes. However, the best definitions of AGI say it must "autonomously perform most economically valuable work better than humans". Vanishingly little economically valuable work by humans consists of answering quizzes using a No. 2 pencil.

Below are concrete economically-valuable achievements by which AIs could be objectively evaluated. Many of these achievements will be subject to human gatekeeping and so might seem unfair. But most of these milestones should be expected on most purported pathways to ASI. If human gatekeeping can prevent many of these milestones, it probably could also prevent ASI and the doom that would purportedly accompany it.

## Occupations

Evals for each occupation:

* Avg number of consecutive hours an AI commercially does the job without more supervision than humans get
* Does the job commercially full-time without such supervision, at lower total amortized cost
* Displaces most humans from that job

## Occupations Already Being Automated

Data are averaged estimates from multiple LLMs, and not to be considered authoritative. (It's 2024 and LLMs still can't reliably research straightforward historical data like this. Indeed, when asked to fill in this table, frontier LLMs routinely hallucinated some occupation codes.)
