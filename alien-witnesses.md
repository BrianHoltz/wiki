# Alien Witnesses

## Witness Taxonomy

- **Insider vs outsider**: whether the witness claims to have been inside an organization, and so could in principle be corroborated by a leak or official disclosure.
- **Credentialed vs uncredentialed**: whether an insider's crdentials have been verified by mainstream evaluators.
- **Eyewitness vs hearsay**: whether the witness claims direct personal experience with the paranormal phenomenon, or at least has disclosed artifacts or source records/media that can be subject to skeptical examination.
  - **Hearsay** examples: my dad saw alien spacecraft at Area 51; a general told me the government had meetings with aliens; my uncle performed an alien autopsy. The dad/general/uncle would be the eyewitnesses, but the people repeating the eyewitness testimony are merely hearsay witnesses.
- **Public experience vs private**: whether the witness's claimed direct personal experience was in a public setting subject to later (dis)confirmation by independent witnesses. We define private-experience witnesses as outsiders, because no organization can corroborate private experience.

## Credentialed eyewitness insider

### Bob Lazar: reverse engineer

Allegedly worked at Area 51 in late 1980s on one of 9 functional alien spaceships, some of which were found in archaeological digs. Debunked on [Knowing Humans](http://blog.knowinghumans.net/2021/03/bob-lazars-2011-nobel-prize.md).

## Uncredentialed eyewitness insider

### Emery Smith: alien autopsist

Claimed to have autopsied over 3,000 alien specimens in underground bases while serving in the US Air Force.
While his Air Force service is verified, his official job was **Surgical Technologist** (a standard medical support role), not Intelligence or Biology. There is no official record of the security clearance or "moonlighting" assignment required for his claims. He has provided no physical evidence or leaked reports to corroborate the "autopsy" assertions.

## Credentialed hearsay insider

### David Grusch

* [2019–2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Grusch_UFO_whistleblower_claims) NRO/NGA Intelligence Officer
* [2019](https://www.newsweek.com/whistleblower-david-grusch-ufo-claims-timeline-1811307) 1st encountered insider reports of NHI
* [2023](https://www.thedebrief.org/intelligence-official-turned-whistleblower-says-u-s-has-retrieved-non-human-craft/) 1st reported claims about NHI
* Grusch is a verified insider and a legal whistleblower, but he admitted under oath that he has **not** seen the craft or bodies himself. His testimony is based on interviewing other insiders and reviewing files. He has not released any documents or photos he claims he viewed.

### Daniel Sheehan

* [1977–1981](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Sheehan_(attorney)) "Sheehan is a constitutional and public interest lawyer, public speaker, political activist and educator."
* (No strong source found for 1st encountered insider UFO reports; Sheehan's own site only says his advocacy dates to Carter administration)
* (No strong source found for 1st public report; Wikipedia and Sheehan's site only state: "Sheehan claims to have *seen* classified photos of UFOs in verified archives (Project Blue Book/Library of Congress). However, he did not leak or reproduce the photos. His testimony is seeing a photo, not being a first-hand eyewitness to the event or craft itself.")

### Robert Salas (USAF Captain/Launch Officer)

Salas was a first-hand witness to the *missile shutdown*, but he was **not** a first-hand witness to the UFO. He admits he was underground in the capsule; the claim of a glowing red object came from the topside security guards calling down to him. This falls under "talking to eyewitnesses."

### Nick Pope (UK Ministry of Defence)

Pope was an official desk officer investigating reports. He does not claim to have seen a craft or alien body himself; his knowledge comes from reading reports and interviewing witnesses (hearsay).

### Paul Hellyer

[Paul Hellyer](http://blog.knowinghumans.net/2021/03/hellyer-reports-on-galactic-federation.md) was Defense MInister of Canada in the 1960s and at age 82 in 2005 read a book (confirmed by some unnamed general) that convinced him the government is hiding its secret relations with at least four alien species who have been visiting Earth for thousands of years. He has learned that the aliens want humans to stop using clear-cutting, fracking, and fossil fuels, and to love each other.

### Donald Keyhoe (USMC Major)

Keyhoe was a verified officer but acted as an author/investigator. His claims were based on sources and leaked *stories*, not his own first-hand sighting of verified alien technology.

### Alfred Webre

[bio](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Omniverse/Alfred-Lambremont-Webre/9781591432159): director of the 1977 Carter White House extraterrestrial communication study, and former NGO delegate to the United Nations

[UFOdigest.com](https://www.ufodigest.com/article/will-we-soon-learn-that-there-are-extraterrestrials-among-us/) (2014): a consortium or regional galactic governance council is responsible for the creation of our species homo sapiens as a 12-strand DNA Light being in the 3rd dimension. Homo sapiens were devolved into a 3-strand DNA slave race 280,000 years ago by the intervention of another predatory species – the Anunnaki – that in fact has instituted the models of all hierarchical monarchies, religions, human governance, and human duality-based monetary systems.

### Bob Dean (US Army Command Sergeant Major)

While a verified insider, Dean only *claimed to have read* the "Assessment" document. He did not leak the physical document for public examination, and he does not claim to have personally seen the aliens/craft in the flesh, only photos within a file he cannot produce.

## Uncredentialed hearsay insider

### Arthur Neumann aka Henry Deacon

There is no public record or documentation confirming his employment at these agencies in a capacity that would grant access to such projects. He has produced no physical documents to support his testimony, making his claims unverifiable hearsay.

[GreatDreams.com (2007)](http://www.greatdreams.com/interview/henry-deacon-planet-x.md): I'm a current employee of one of the three letter agencies. I'm probably taking quite a risk by speaking to you like this, though I don't intend to reveal any information that in my judgment is both classified and specific to national security. I've been involved in many projects with many different agencies over many years. [...] I have memories of coming from another planet, and these are all mixed up, all mingled with human boyhood memories. [...] if you're creating rips in spacetime you're messing with time itself, whether you mean to or not. There have been attempts to fix that, and it all results in a complicated overlay of time loops. Some ETs are trying to help, and others, others are not. [...] Only one or two ET groups are concerned about nuclear weapons, not all of them. [...] The Montauk Project caused a huge problem, and generated a 40-year [time] loop. [...] One of the portals connects to Mars, and it's a stable connection, no matter where Earth and Mars are in their orbits. We have a base there established in the early sixties. Actually, we have a number of bases. [...] The people there [on Alpha Centauri] are very human-like. They're not Grays, they're like us. The human form is very common in the universe. [...] We should never have done it [shot down that UFO]. The disk was disabled and it was captured, and so were the occupants, and I saw these very briefly. They were small child-like humanoids, with no hair. And they had small eyes, not large almond-shaped eyes. [...] there are many groups of ETs, and besides our own ancestors are mixed in there. There are time loops upon time loops, and it's all a mess.

### Emery Smith

[d0303.com (2018)](https://do303.com/events/2018/7/7/emery-smith-alien-autopsy-crash-retrieval-time-travel): Emery Smith, former Air Force field medic, has provided detailed accounts of autopsying over 3,000 alien specimens, and over 1200 nearly complete bodies. As a result, we are gaining new intel about the massive number of alien species we share our universe with. Emery speaks out despite threats on his life [...] This work also involved direct interactions with a variety of different living ETs who advised him. He also got to see and take samples of the craft that some of them had arrived in [...] For those that want to meet Emery and David Wilcock in person, there are 28 VIP tickets available for an intimate, fully catered meet and greet before the show. [...]

### Corey Goode

Claimed to serve 20 years in a "Secret Space Program" (Solar Warden) and interact with the "Sphere Being Alliance."
Goode has no verified military service record (no DD214). His claims rely on "recovered memories" and "intuitive" channeling rather than documented physical events witnessed during a confirmed official tenure. He has produced zero physical leaked documents.

[SphereBeingAlliance.com](https://spherebeingalliance.com/about-me): Identified as an intuitive empath (IE), Corey Goode was recruited through one of the MILAB programs at the young age of six. (MILAB is a term coined for the military abduction of a person that indoctrinates and trains them for any number of military black ops programs.) Goode trained and served in the MILAB program from 1976-1986/87. Toward the end of his time at MILAB he was assigned to fill an IE support role for a rotating Earth Delegate Seat (shared by secret earth government groups) in a "human-type" ET SuperFederation Council.

[SphereBeingAlliance.com](https://spherebeingalliance.com/faqs/tag/moon): The moon is an ancient "device" or space station that was built by the "Ancient Builder Race". It is hollow after hundreds of feet of debris that have collected on it.

## Template

This is a template for an insider entry. Every link MUST be validated. Every quote MUST be checkable in the linked source. Human revieweres will check every link and every quote. Research this deeply for the source(s) tha are most faithful to the witness's claim. Prefer sources that reliably quote the witness instead of paraphrasing him.

### First Last

* [YYYY-YYYY](link to source) Quote from source describing (alleged) insider position.
* [YYYY](link to source) 1st encountered "quote from source describing earliest experience"
* [YYYY](link to source) 1st reported claims that "quote from source describing most extreme claim"
* [title of text describing claims](link to non-hallucinated source for this info): "direct quotes from this source describing the witness's most extreme claims"
