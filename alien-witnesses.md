# Alien Witnesses

## Witness Taxonomy

- **Insider vs outsider**: whether the witness claims to have been inside an organization, and so could in principle be corroborated by a leak or official disclosure.
- **Credentialed vs uncredentialed**: whether an insider's crdentials have been verified by mainstream evaluators.
- **Eyewitness vs hearsay**: whether the witness claims direct personal experience with the paranormal phenomenon, or at least has disclosed artifacts or source records/media that can be subject to skeptical examination.
  - **Hearsay** examples: my dad saw alien spacecraft at Area 51; a general told me the government had meetings with aliens; my uncle performed an alien autopsy. The dad/general/uncle would be the eyewitnesses, but the people repeating the eyewitness testimony are merely hearsay witnesses.
- **Public experience vs private**: whether the witness's claimed direct personal experience was in a public setting subject to later (dis)confirmation by independent witnesses. We define private-experience witnesses as outsiders, because no organization can corroborate private experience.

## Credentialed eyewitness insider

### Bob Lazar

* [1988–1989](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Lazar) Claims to have been employed as a "Senior Staff Physicist" at Sector 4 (S-4) near Groom Lake, Nevada.
* [1988](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UjqFaQq_7I) 1st encountered insider reports when he was allegedly hired and briefed on the propulsion systems of nine extraterrestrial discs, some of which were found in archaeological digs.
* [1989](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GRjgBVw9Pk) 1st reported claims in a May interview with George Knapp on KLAS-TV, appearing in shadow under the pseudonym "Dennis."
* [The Lazar Tape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoecOE2RKdk): Claims the craft was powered by an antimatter reactor using **Element 115** (Moscovium) to generate a "gravity wave" that bends space-time. Describes the "Sport Model" disc as being "made of a metallic substance similar in appearance and touch to liquid titanium" with no welding or seams.
* Lazar is the primary source for the "S-4" reverse-engineering narrative. While he claims to be an insider, his credentials are unverified: MIT and Caltech have no record of his attendance, and Los Alamos National Laboratory phone books list him as a technician for a contractor (Kirk-Mayer), not a physicist. His only physical evidence, a W-2 form, lists a non-existent "Department of Naval Intelligence." His claims rely entirely on his own testimony without corroborated witnesses or leaked documentation.
* Debunked on [Knowing Humans](http://blog.knowinghumans.net/2021/03/bob-lazars-2011-nobel-prize.md).

## Uncredentialed eyewitness insider

### Emery Smith: alien autopsist

Claimed to have autopsied over 3,000 alien specimens in underground bases while serving in the US Air Force.
While his Air Force service is verified, his official job was **Surgical Technologist** (a standard medical support role), not Intelligence or Biology. There is no official record of the security clearance or "moonlighting" assignment required for his claims. He has provided no physical evidence or leaked reports to corroborate the "autopsy" assertions.

## Credentialed hearsay insider

### David Grusch

* [2007-2021](https://www.congress.gov/118/meeting/house/116282/documents/HHRG-118-GO06-Transcript-20230726.pdf) — “intelligence officer for 14 years … most recently … at the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency … at the GS–15 civilian level.”
* [2019](https://www.congress.gov/118/meeting/house/116282/documents/HHRG-118-GO06-Transcript-20230726.pdf)  1st encountered NHI evidence when "I was informed in the course of my official duties of a multi-decade UAP crash retrieval and reverse engineering program to which I was denied access to those additional read-ons when I requested it."
* [2023](https://www.congress.gov/118/meeting/house/116282/documents/HHRG-118-GO06-Transcript-20230726.pdf) 1st disclosed that "biologics came with some of these recoveries."
* Grusch would not publically disclose whether "our government has made contact with intelligent extraterrestrials" or how his sources determined the "biologics [that] came with some of these recoveries" were "nonhuman". He frames his most extreme claims (recovered craft, biologics) as second-hand. He denies firsthand observation of craft or bodies and has not released publicly reviewable documents or images.

### Daniel Sheehan

* [1975–1985](https://www.danielpsheehan.com/about/) Chief Counsel, National Office of Social Ministries of the Jesuit Order.
* [1977](https://www.ufojoe.net/sheehanlueig/) 1st experienced alien evidence when “In approximately May of 1977, I went to the Madison building of the United States Library of Congress" while “designated as a special consultant” to the Congressional Research Service / Library of Congress. “I was given access … to the classified portions of Project Blue Book …”. I saw “photographs … of what is unquestionably an unidentified flying object on the ground …”. “I physically traced the copies of the symbols …”
* [2021](https://www.ufojoe.net/sheehanlueig/) 1st disclosed his 1977 discoveries.
* Sheehan's UFO-related claims merely a one-time archival access and viewing of photographs—not firsthand witnessing of a craft, bodies, or an operational program. He did not leak or reproduce the materials he described 44 years later.
* Marcia Smith authored the 1976 Congressional Research Service report The UFO Enigma while serving as an Analyst in Science and Technology at the Library of Congress. The paper concludes that the subject remains unresolved due to poor data quality, inconsistent reporting, and the absence of decisive physical evidence; it does not endorse the extraterrestrial hypothesis. Despite Sheehan’s later claims, we can find no documentary or on-the-record evidence that Smith worked with Daniel Sheehan, supervised him, or designated him as a consultant in connection with her CRS work.

### Robert Salas (USAF Captain/Launch Officer)

Salas was a first-hand witness to the *missile shutdown*, but he was **not** a first-hand witness to the UFO. He admits he was underground in the capsule; the claim of a glowing red object came from the topside security guards calling down to him. This falls under "talking to eyewitnesses."

### Nick Pope (UK Ministry of Defence)

Pope was an official desk officer investigating reports. He does not claim to have seen a craft or alien body himself; his knowledge comes from reading reports and interviewing witnesses (hearsay).

### Paul Hellyer

* [1963–1967](https://lop.parl.ca/sites/ParlInfo/default/en_CA/People/Profile?personId=1433) Served as the **Minister of National Defence** for Canada under Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson.
* [2005](https://thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/paul-hellyer) 1st encountered "insider" reports *after* his political career, specifically by reading Col. Philip Corso's book *The Day After Roswell*, which he said confirmed his suspicions.
* [2005](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt1WVeyMqdo) 1st reported claims publicly at a symposium at the University of Toronto, stating, "UFOs are as real as the airplanes that fly over your head."
* [SophieCo Interview (RT)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFl29Uos9K8): Claims that "at least four known alien species have been visiting Earth for thousands of years" and that there is a **"Galactic Federation"** that manages these interactions. He asserts that some aliens, such as the "Tall Whites," are currently working with the U.S. government and can "walk down the street and you wouldn’t know."
* [Knowing Humans](http://blog.knowinghumans.net/2021/03/hellyer-reports-on-galactic-federation.md) Hellyer at age 82 in 2005 read a book (allegedly confirmed by some unnamed general) that convinced him the government is hiding its secret relations with at least four alien species who have been visiting Earth for thousands of years. He has learned that the aliens want humans to stop using clear-cutting, fracking, and fossil fuels, and to love each other.

### Donald Keyhoe (USMC Major)

Keyhoe was a verified officer but acted as an author/investigator. His claims were based on sources and leaked *stories*, not his own first-hand sighting of verified alien technology.

### Alfred Webre

[bio](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Omniverse/Alfred-Lambremont-Webre/9781591432159): director of the 1977 Carter White House extraterrestrial communication study, and former NGO delegate to the United Nations

[UFOdigest.com](https://www.ufodigest.com/article/will-we-soon-learn-that-there-are-extraterrestrials-among-us/) (2014): a consortium or regional galactic governance council is responsible for the creation of our species homo sapiens as a 12-strand DNA Light being in the 3rd dimension. Homo sapiens were devolved into a 3-strand DNA slave race 280,000 years ago by the intervention of another predatory species – the Anunnaki – that in fact has instituted the models of all hierarchical monarchies, religions, human governance, and human duality-based monetary systems.

### Bob Dean (US Army Command Sergeant Major)

While a verified insider, Dean only *claimed to have read* the "Assessment" document. He did not leak the physical document for public examination, and he does not claim to have personally seen the aliens/craft in the flesh, only photos within a file he cannot produce.

## Uncredentialed hearsay insider

### Arthur Neumann aka Henry Deacon

There is no public record or documentation confirming his employment at these agencies in a capacity that would grant access to such projects. He has produced no physical documents to support his testimony, making his claims unverifiable hearsay.

[GreatDreams.com (2007)](http://www.greatdreams.com/interview/henry-deacon-planet-x.md): I'm a current employee of one of the three letter agencies. I'm probably taking quite a risk by speaking to you like this, though I don't intend to reveal any information that in my judgment is both classified and specific to national security. I've been involved in many projects with many different agencies over many years. [...] I have memories of coming from another planet, and these are all mixed up, all mingled with human boyhood memories. [...] if you're creating rips in spacetime you're messing with time itself, whether you mean to or not. There have been attempts to fix that, and it all results in a complicated overlay of time loops. Some ETs are trying to help, and others, others are not. [...] Only one or two ET groups are concerned about nuclear weapons, not all of them. [...] The Montauk Project caused a huge problem, and generated a 40-year [time] loop. [...] One of the portals connects to Mars, and it's a stable connection, no matter where Earth and Mars are in their orbits. We have a base there established in the early sixties. Actually, we have a number of bases. [...] The people there [on Alpha Centauri] are very human-like. They're not Grays, they're like us. The human form is very common in the universe. [...] We should never have done it [shot down that UFO]. The disk was disabled and it was captured, and so were the occupants, and I saw these very briefly. They were small child-like humanoids, with no hair. And they had small eyes, not large almond-shaped eyes. [...] there are many groups of ETs, and besides our own ancestors are mixed in there. There are time loops upon time loops, and it's all a mess.

### Emery Smith

[d0303.com (2018)](https://do303.com/events/2018/7/7/emery-smith-alien-autopsy-crash-retrieval-time-travel): Emery Smith, former Air Force field medic, has provided detailed accounts of autopsying over 3,000 alien specimens, and over 1200 nearly complete bodies. As a result, we are gaining new intel about the massive number of alien species we share our universe with. Emery speaks out despite threats on his life [...] This work also involved direct interactions with a variety of different living ETs who advised him. He also got to see and take samples of the craft that some of them had arrived in [...] For those that want to meet Emery and David Wilcock in person, there are 28 VIP tickets available for an intimate, fully catered meet and greet before the show. [...]

### Corey Goode

Claimed to serve 20 years in a "Secret Space Program" (Solar Warden) and interact with the "Sphere Being Alliance."
Goode has no verified military service record (no DD214). His claims rely on "recovered memories" and "intuitive" channeling rather than documented physical events witnessed during a confirmed official tenure. He has produced zero physical leaked documents.

[SphereBeingAlliance.com](https://spherebeingalliance.com/about-me): Identified as an intuitive empath (IE), Corey Goode was recruited through one of the MILAB programs at the young age of six. (MILAB is a term coined for the military abduction of a person that indoctrinates and trains them for any number of military black ops programs.) Goode trained and served in the MILAB program from 1976-1986/87. Toward the end of his time at MILAB he was assigned to fill an IE support role for a rotating Earth Delegate Seat (shared by secret earth government groups) in a "human-type" ET SuperFederation Council.

[SphereBeingAlliance.com](https://spherebeingalliance.com/faqs/tag/moon): The moon is an ancient "device" or space station that was built by the "Ancient Builder Race". It is hollow after hundreds of feet of debris that have collected on it.

## Public-experience eyewitness outsider

Vallee is a researcher and analyst of the phenomenon. While he worked on Blue Book databases, he does not claim to be a whistleblower of a specific recovered craft he saw personally.

### David Jacobs (Professor)

Jacobs conducts hypnosis on *other* people (abductees). He is a researcher of third-party testimony, not a first-hand witness to the phenomena.

### Frank Scully (Journalist)

Scully was a journalist who published stories given to him by Silas Newton (who was later determined to be a con man). Scully had no first-hand access.
